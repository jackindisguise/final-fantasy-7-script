Hey, CLOUD.
Think there's anything I'd be good at?
Zack
Hey old guy!
What do you think I'd be good at?
What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya?
Young folks should try everything!
You gotta pay your dues while you're young. Go out and look for what you really want.
Zack
Yeah, whatever…
Zack
Find my own way?
Try everything… That's easy for him to say.

Hey…didn't you even hear a word I said?
Zack
Yeah! Thanks Pops!
No, wait…you got it all wrong.
Zack
Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that.
Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money.
I'm gonna be rich!
Zack
