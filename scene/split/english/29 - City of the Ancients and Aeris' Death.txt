Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.
What do you want?
Where is the City of the Ancients?
Do you know where AERIS is?
What are you doing?
Have you seen Sephiroth?
Oh, the man in a black cape. He was looking for the Temple of the Ancients.
The Temple of the Ancients?
Thanks
It's way down south. It's on the other side of this town and the inland sea.
It's the pyramid rising out of the forest.
How do you get in?
That's enough
You'll need the Keystone.
What's a Keystone?
Oh, yeah, I know
Just like it sounds. A rock that's a key. I heard that some rich guy has it.
Are you going to run away??
Through fossils, we already know everything that happened on this Planet since the beginning.
Now, we want to see the rest on to the end of the Planet… It's a mixed feeling…
The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City.
Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went into the Sleeping Forest anyway.
Excavating is great. It's like a history of the Planet told in the land.
This town's motto is not to think about anything.
Just live. Eat, work, and sleep.
It's pretty hard not to think about anything.
Want to buy something?
I want the Lunar Harp
Don't want anything
Thanks! Now, the forest will awaken.
The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could excavate it for you if you want us to.
Start diggin'
I want to buy something
Not right now
Other than the Lunar Harp, What else do you want us to dig for?
Lunar Harp
Good treasure
Normal treasure
This has already been excavated.
All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where you want us to dig!
Everything already excavated is in the box next to the tent.
The memory of this planet is buried layer by layer in this geological stratum. Kind of romantic, don't you think?
The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right now the forest is asleep. Anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, gets confused. You can go in, but you may never come out…
But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a black cape went in. You think they'll be all right?
You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp.
Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you.
The girl in pink who just went in used a Lunar Harp to get through.
I want a Lunar Harp
Ask the guy in the tent below.
We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We use bombs to make earthquakes, and then check the sound waves given off by the tremors.
Please push [SWITCH] to set staff in position.
Order a search (100 gil)
Could not position the staff, due to a lack of funds.
Press [SWITCH] to ignite the bomb for the search.
The staff member will calculate the tremors and dig up the buried item.
The dig point is where the staff's line of vision meets.
Move to the dig point and press [SWITCH] to select. The staff will dig for the item.
Now, the staff will dig here. The result will be placed in the treasure box overnight.
Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that.
It, it's scary…
Just a while ago, a young girl asked me the same things.
Then the entrance to the forest made a funny sound, like 'Grrrrrrgh!'.
I thought that maybe I could do it, too.
Please, let me in!
While ago, a man in black came and said this as he went into the forest.
Nnnnnnghaah!
The Sleeping Forest awoke…
This place…!
So that's……the capital of the Ancients The Forgotten City'.
AERIS is in that 'City'.
…Ugh.
…Words of the Ancients?
…No good. I can't understand.
…Ugh, again?
This stream of consciousness… Could this be the words of the Ancients…?
Eyaaaa!
…Consciousness of the Ancients?
…I'm sorry. …I can't…understand.
Eaayy!? Again?
It speaks directly to my mind… Is this the Consciousness of the Ancients?
Whoa…!
What the hell's this?
Hey Ancients, I don't even have a clue what you're trying to say to me.
Whoa, @#$%! Not again!
Who is it? Who's trying to peek into my mind?
Is it the Consciousness of the Ancients?
Hey, there's a bed.
Do you think the people who used to live here used it?
Look, there's a bed here.
Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable.
How COOL! I can't believe we found such a soft bed in a dive like this.
We're in luck. There's a bed in here.
I wonder if the owners used this?
Yo, CLOUD. Let's take a break here.
Shall we take a break here?
Hey, let's rest a bit. I'm tired…
I'm beat. Why don't we get some rest?
Come on--, let's rest for a while--- I don't want to walk anymore…
Why don't we catch some ZZZs?…
Maybe we should take a short nap?
Here's a bed.
Get some rest?
I feel it…
AERIS is here. …and so is Sephiroth.
…It's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul.
CLOUD, what is it?
CLOUD…what's wrong?
What's wrong? Are you sick?
Do you know what TIME it is!?
Hey---, CLOUD. What's your problem?
What's wrong? What time is it…?
…What's wrong?
Wh, what! Sephiroth!?
You're saying it's not just AERIS, but Sephiroth, too?
What! Sephiroth's here too!?
Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?
No way---! Sephiroth wasn't invited!
Are you serious, CLOUD!?
…If that's true, then we're in for it.
How do you know that?
But how can you tell?
How did you find out?
Hey, how do you know!?
Wh…why? How can you tell that kind of stuff?
But how can you tell that?
…How did you find that out?
Then, we better get up offa our lazy asses!!
If that's true, then we've got to hurry! We've got to get to AERIS!
Wh,…what should we do? We must hurry to her!
@#$$, CLOUD. We can't be sittin' around on our asses.
That means it's pretty bad …doesn't it?
If that's true, then we're in for it! We have to find AERIS fast!
If that's true, we should hurry. Something terrible could happen at any moment.
…Right. Let's hurry and find AERIS.
No time to be sleeping.
No time to think about it.
AERIS's voice…… Coming from there?
We have to find AERIS.
Hey yo! Wait up.
I hate to say it, but I'm beat. Isn't there anywhere to rest.
Hey, hey CLOUD.
I'm…I'm so tired. Can't we find somewhere to rest?
Wait!
I'm exhausted. Let me get some rest somewhere.
H…ey, CLOUD
I gotta get some more rest. Let me catch a snooze somewhere around here.
Ahhh--- I can't go another step!!
I'm so----o tired! If you don't get me to a bed, I'm not taking another step!
Wa------it!
I'm exhausted. I'm sorry, but please let me rest somewhere.
Wait, CLOUD.
…I'm tired.
That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find AERIS.
If we continue this way, we'll end up in the Northern Mountains. AERIS isn't over there, right?
That road leads to the Northern Mountains. We have to go the other way to find AERIS.
You thinkin' of going skiing? If we wanna find AERIS, we go THAT way!
We're looking for AERIS, right! Then why are you heading for the mountains!? What a dork!
CLOUD, uh that's the road to the Northern Mountains.
AERIS is waiting, let's go find her.
This is the road to the Northern Mountains. Don't you want to find AERIS?
Stop!
Please stop that!
What're you doing!
Sto----p!
Dumb #^%@!
Stop it!
Ugh…what are you making me do?
…stay…back…
…AERIS.
This can't be real!
Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's energy.
All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for me over the snowy fields.
There, I will become a new being by uniting with the Planet. As will this girl…
…Shut up.
The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing.
AERIS is gone.
AERIS will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry…or get angry…
What about us…what are WE supposed to do?
What is this pain?
My fingers are tingling. My mouth is dry. My eyes are burning!
What are you talking about? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings now?
Of course! What do you think I am!?
Ha, ha, ha…… Stop acting as if you are sad.
And there's no need to act as if you're angry either.
Because, CLOUD. You are…
Jenova
Because, you are…a puppet.
You are…
I'm…a puppet?
Everyone‚listen to me.
I'm CLOUD‚ex-SOLDIER‚ born in Nibelheim.
I came to settle up with Sephiroth.
What're ya tryin' to say?
…Hmm?
I heard that before.
Why now?
Why're you being so formal? Is something wrong?
I came here by my own free will… Or so I thought.
However…
…To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself.
…There is a part of me that I don't understand.
That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth.
If you hadn't stopped me, AERIS might have been…
…There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me.
That's why I should quit this journey.
Before I do something terrible.
But I am going.
He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed AERIS‚and is now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive…Sephiroth.
I… I must go on.
…I have a favor to ask of you.
Will you all come with me?
…to save me from doing something terrible.
…I dunno‚ man…
…But‚CLOUD
…All right‚CLOUD.
Well‚ we'll face it when it happens.
Leave it to me!
Watch you?…… We're all in this together!
I don't know how AERIS tried to save the planet from the Meteor.
And I guess now, we'll never know.
We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses it.
Let's go.

Which way'd that damn foo' Sephiroth go?
Sephiroth… I wonder which way he went?
Sephiroth… which way did he go?
…Which way did that creep Sephiroth go!?
Ummm… Which way did that Sephiroth guy go?
I wonder which way Sephiroth went?
Which way did Sephiroth head?
Hey, you alright?
CLOUD! Get a hold of yourself!!
You all right?
Ey, hey! You alright?
Wait! Get a hold of yourself!
CLOUD! Are you all right?
Sephiroth said to me… Head North…… ……past the Snow Fields……
…ugh.
