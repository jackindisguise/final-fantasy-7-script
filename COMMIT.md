# Changelog Scopes
Since I keep forgetting what words to use, I made this file for future reference.

## `script`
These are the "script" files. Not in the sense of the textual script of the game, but the programming scripts.

**General rule:** Any changes to anything in `src/` goes under this scope.

## `scene`
**General rule:** Any changes to anything in `scene/` goes under this scope.

## `spreadsheet`
**General rule:** Any changes to anything in `spreadsheet/` goes here.
