President Shinra
How are the preparations going?
Heidegger
Gya, haa, haa!!  Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to this.
Reeve
President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a group with only a few members…
President Shinra
What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?
Reeve
…No.
But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why…
Heidegger
Reeve, flush your personal problems with the rest of your crap!
Reeve
The Mayor's against this anyway…
Heidegger
Mayor?
He just sits in this building all day feeding his face! You still call that a Mayor?
Heidegger
Now if you'll excuse me sir!
President Shinra
You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go somewhere.
President Shinra
We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then we'll send in the rescue operation, care of Shinra, Inc…. Heh, heh, heh…this is perfect.
Heidegger
Gya, haaa, haa!
Sewer
Man! This is terrible.
You alright?
Yeah.
Well, the worst is over…
Maybe not…
Let's try and jump down
Let's not…
It's too late… Marlene…BARRET …the people of the Slums.
Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?
…Yeah…you're right! We still have time.
Train Graveyard
AERIS, I got you mixed up in this…
Don't tell me to go home.
If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here.
[Save Point]
Received "Hi-Potion"!
Received "Ether"!
Received "Potion"!
Received "Echo Screen"!
We made it! The pillar's standing!
Wait! You hear something above us?
…gun fire?
BARRET?
I'm going up!
AERIS! You look after Wedge.
AERIS, do me a favor.
I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.
There's a little girl named Marlene there.
Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
It's dangerous here! Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!
Everyone get out of Sector 7!
Wedge!! You all right!?
Wedge
…CLOUD. You remembered…my name.
Wedge
BARRET's up top. …Help him…
Wedge
An' CLOUD… Sorry, I wasn't any help.
Wedge
CLOUD… It hurts…
CLOUD!! You've gotta go now, or BARRET's…
Hey now!! Oops!!
What on earth are you doing? Just butt out…geez!
Huh? You came to see it, too?
There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust…
Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.
Hey!! Check it out! It's huge, ain't it?
Hey… This is a strange and wonderful place.
This is my place, but you can come here when you want. See ya, bro!
Ah…eh…uhm. Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance.
Did I do good this time?
You gotta be tougher!
But, uh, I…
W, wow! You're great!!
Damn right!! Don't waste time talkin's what I always say!
What the hell do you want? You know who I am?
You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.
If you understand, then scram!
Listen… My partner's pretty mean, I wouldn't get him mad, if I were you.
You know, I got some tickets to 'Loveless', do you want to go?
What're you, retarded? Midgar's under martial law now!
Sir, are you really concerned for me?
Hell no!! But in case you forgot, we're in the middle of a slum. They could be anywhere around, so stay on your guard.
Right. You mean the AVALANCHE?
Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.
Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it?
I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam?
Damn right!! blahblahblah…
Hey shut up for a minute and let me get back to work!
…sigh.
What are you more scared of AVALANCHE or me?
Oh, you, of course.
HALT!! No one is allowed to pass!!
[Save Point]
Don't worry. You let me handle this.
Uh oh… There goes the pillar.
I'm scared, but it's for your own good.
If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll see happen too often.
Uhh…Help! My strange and wonderful little place.
L, look… This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute.
Umm… I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here with you.
B, but… What happens if AVALANCHE shows up?
Umm…you're shaking. You're so gentle…I think I'm in love.
Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!
I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great… I'm quitting tomorrow!
Jessie
…CLOUD… I'm glad……I could talk with you…one last time.
Don't say 'last'……
Is that so…
Jessie
That's…all right…
Because…of our actions…many……people died…… this probably……is our punishment…
…Is…that so……?
Ha……cool……as usual… ex-…SOLDIER. …always…I liked that…in you…
Biggs
CLOUD… so you don't care…what happens… to the…Planet?
Nope, not interested
You're wounded……
Hmph…you haven't changed. Oh, forget it.
Thanks, CLOUD. …don't worry 'bout me…… BARRET's…fighting up there. Go help him…
TIFA! CLOUD! You came!
Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter.
Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force!

Reno
You're too late. Once I push this button…
Reno
That's all, folks! Mission accomplished.
DAMN! It's a time bomb!
We have to disarm it! CLOUD! BARRET! Please!
Reno
I can't have you do that. No one get in the way of Reno and the Turks…
CLOUD! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!
…It's not a normal time bomb.
Tseng
That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.
It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
Please, stop it!
Tseng
Ha ha ha……
Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.
Shut yer hole!
Tseng
I wouldn't try that…… You just might make me injure our special guest.
Tseng
Oh, you know each other?
Tseng
How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me.
What are you gonna do with AERIS!?
Tseng
I haven't decided.
Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.
Tseng
It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President.
TIFA, don't worry! She's all right!
Hurry and get out!
Tseng
Ha, ha, ha… Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?
We're not going to make it!
Yo, we can use this wire to get out!
Jus' hang on to me!
Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!
Marlene! MARLENE!!
MAR---LE---NE!!
Biggs!
Wedge!!
Jessie!!
Goddamn it!!!
Dammit!
DAMMIT ALL!!!!
What the hell's it all for!?
ARGGHHHH!!!
Hey, BARRET!
BARRET!
Hey!
BARRET, stop… Please stop, BARRET.
URGHHHH!!!
God damn…
Marlene…
… BARRET?
Marlene is… I think Marlene is safe.
…huh?
Right before they took AERIS, she said, 'Don't worry, she's all right.' She was probably talking about Marlene.
Rrr, really!?
But…
Biggs… Wedge… Jessie…
All three of them were in the pillar.
Think I don't know that?
But…we, all of us fought together.
I don't wanna think of them as dead!
…And the other people in Sector 7.
This is all screwed up!
They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people…
…Are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
No, TIFA! That ain't it! Hell no!!
It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra!
They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to…
build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!
Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!
…I don't know.
What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
It's not that. I'm not sure about…me. My feelings.
An' what about you?
…
Yo!
Where's he think he's goin'?
Oh! AERIS!
Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?
…I don't really know… but she's the one I left Marlene with.
Damn! Marlene!!
AERIS said that Marlene was safe.
TIFA. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Sector 6 park
You may not take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "Sense" Materia!
CLOUD!
Take me to Marlene!
You're going to help AERIS?
Yeah… But before that, there's something I want to know.
What's that?
…It's about the Ancients.
Now listen good! The Ancients are the rightful rulers of this Planet!
"Sephiroth…?"
Are you all right?
Pull it together, man!
Sector 6
In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!
