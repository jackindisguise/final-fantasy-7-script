It's a strange plant that hangs down from above. It's mouth is usually open to catch insects.
When an insect gets in, it closes its mouth, trapping it. It's lid's stronger than it looks. It's big enough to hold a human. But it's really picky and spits out lots of stuff.
Be really cautious with this flower. It'll snap at anything. If you're going to go through here… do it the instant it closes its mouth.
It may not look it…or maybe it does, but this insect is really timid. If you go near it, it'll run away… If you touch it, it'll just turn in to a ball…
