…To wake me from the nightmare
Who is it!?
…I don't know you. You must leave.
CLOUD
You were having a nightmare.
TIFA
You were having a nightmare.
CID
You were having a nightmare.
BARRET
I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
CAIT SITH
Aren't you glad you woke up?
AERIS
You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
TIFA
How bad was your dream?
RED XIII
…You don't look good.
YUFFIE
Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!
CID
The air's pretty heavy here.
How can you sleep in a place like this?
Hmph…a nightmare? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
CLOUD
What are you saying?
TIFA
What's he talking about?
CID
What the hell are you saying?
I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.
This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
CLOUD
…You can say that again.
TIFA
…That's for sure.
CID
…It's startin' to look that way!
Hmm? Do you know something?
Don't say a thing
Talk about Sephiroth
CLOUD
Nothing I'd tell a stranger.
TIFA
Nothing I feel like telling a stranger about.
CID
Nothin' I'd tell a stranger.
Again… Do you know anything?
Nothing
Tell him about Sephiroth
I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare…
…Do you have something to tell me?
No, good night
Tell him about Sephiroth
…Hmm.
CLOUD
Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.
TIFA
Just like you said, this mansion is the start of a nightmare…
CID
It's like you said, this mansion's the beginning of a nightmare.
CLOUD
No, it's not a dream, it's for real.
TIFA
No, not a dream…it's reality.
CID
No, it's not a dream, it's the truth.
CLOUD
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion…
TIFA
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion…
CID
Sephiroth's gone nuts. He found a ton of secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth!?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You start first.
CLOUD
…That's how it was.
TIFA
…That's how it was.
CID
…That's how it was.
So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?
…He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.
He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.
CLOUD
Now it's your turn.
TIFA
Now it's your turn.
CID
Now it's your turn.
Sorry…I cannot speak.
BARRET
Hey! You lyin' white-faced…
CAIT SITH
Hey, that's not right---
AERIS
That's dirty!
TIFA
Hmm…I'm disappointed.
RED XIII
What…you're serious?
YUFFIE
Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway.
CID
Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!
Hearing your stories, is yet another sin for me.
More nightmares shall come to me now, than I previously had.
Now…please leave.
…You're still here.
Good night
Who are you?
CLOUD
At least tell us your name.
TIFA
At least tell us your name.
CID
At least say your name.
I was with…Shinra Manufacturing in Administrative Research, also known as--the Turks.
VINCENT.
CLOUD
The Turks!?
TIFA
The Turks!?
CID
Turks!?
VINCENT
Formerly of the Turks.
I have no affiliation with Shinra now.
VINCENT
…And you?
CLOUD
CLOUD, formerly of SOLDIER.
CLOUD
Former SOLDIER, CLOUD.
TIFA
TIFA, formerly of the AVALANCHE.
CID
CID, formerly of the Space Program Department.
VINCENT
You were also with Shinra…? Then do you know Lucrecia?
VINCENT
Ex-AVALANCHE… Then you wouldn't know Lucrecia…
CLOUD
Who?
TIFA
Who?
CID
Who?
VINCENT
…Lucrecia.
CLOUD
I don't.
TIFA
No.
CID
No idea.
VINCENT
The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
CLOUD
…gave birth…?
Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
TIFA
…gave birth…?
Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
CID
…gave birth…?
Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
VINCENT
That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.
VINCENT
He was born from a beautiful lady.
VINCENT
That lady was Lucrecia.
She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful…Lucrecia.
CLOUD
…A human experiment?
TIFA
…A human experiment?
CID
…A human experiment?
VINCENT
There was no way to cancel the experiment.
VINCENT
I couldn't stop her.
VINCENT
That was my sin.
VINCENT
I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.
BARRET
So you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
AERIS
So your punishment was to sleep? That's…strange.
TIFA
So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
RED XIII
So you slept as punishment? Isn't that rather strange logic?
CID
You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?
CAIT SITH
You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
YUFFIE
OK. Boring story no.1.
VINCENT
Let me sleep…
VINCENT
Wait!
VINCENT
If I go with you, will I meet Hojo?
VINCENT
If I go with you, will I meet Hojo?
CLOUD
Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later…
TIFA
Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might……
CID
I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance…
CLOUD
Yeah, probably…
TIFA
Yes, probably…
CID
Yeah, probably…
VINCENT
Lucrecia…
VINCENT
All right. I've decided to go with you.
BARRET
W, what?
TIFA
What? You're coming with us?
RED XIII
What?
AERIS
That sure was a quick change of heart.
CAIT SITH
What?
CID
Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!
YUFFIE
Huh? Oh great just what I needed…
VINCENT
Being a former Turk, I may be of help…
CLOUD
All right, then.
TIFA
All right, I understand.
CID
Alright then.
