The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?
Where's AERIS?
AERIS? How did you know that name? You must be…
AERIS, you mean that kid. The receptionist? I was startin' to worry about her, too.
And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?
You mean, she's not? It's someone else?
Oh, I see. So you must be that whatcha call it…
Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!
You know, this building looks like it's starting to fall apart.
This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right away.
Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors, too. Here, take this.
Received Key Item "Keycard 62"!
This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for the company big wigs.
It's tough working under someone. It wears you out.
I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know what that was all about?
No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th floor is safe.
What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?
Even employees can't access floors above the 60th without a keycard.
I don't remember seeing your face before… You new here?
Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some…things.
Things?
Um, I'm kinda in a hurry…
Oh? That's too bad…
Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach you how to get to the next floor.
The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th floor. But you can't get there without a keycard.
Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely.
…voila! Hear that sound and the door will open.
Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard alone won't let you go everywhere.
For example,
'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. Keycard 65' only takes you to the 65th floor.
It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, they control everything in Midgar and in the world for that matter.
Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!

How do you do?
This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office.
I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me…
Domino
Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?
You all must be those…ahem… Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of Midgar.
Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc.
My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents…
Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh…
You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard.
Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard!
Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!
Got it? Then tell me.
So, what's the password?
BEST
KING
ORBS
BOMB
MAKO
HOJO
Wait a second
Nope! You're ALL wrong! It's a much better word than that! Try again!
BEST!!
God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best…ME!! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
KING!!
God, I love the sound of that! KING!! President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!
BOMB!!
God, I love the sound of that! BOMB!! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode!
MAKO!!
God, I love the sound of that! MAKO! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor!
Received "Keycard 65"!
Why would I do something like this, you ask?
Revenge, of course!
Shinra's been torturing me forever.
That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer.
This ought to teach them! Heh heh heh…
But my card will only get you to the 65th floor.
Can you believe how they treat me? …ME! Like some common employee…
Did you speak with the Mayor?
What? A password? Oh, I get it…
He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.
Maybe I can help you.
What do you want to know?
The password…duh!
How about a hint?
Get out of my face
…I see. Then, I guess that's that.
Good luck finding it on your own.
If you decide you want help. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime…
What can I do for you?
Give me the hint again
Give me the next hint
Uh, nothing
Sure, sure. All right.
As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.
So here's a hint…
…for 500 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 1000 gil.
…for 2000 gil.
…for 5000 gil.
…for 15000 gil.
HELP
Hey now! You're a bit short.
No one works on credit nowadays… not even stores in the slums.
I can't believe it! I gave you all these hints, and you STILL don't get it?
You guys are amazing! Really, amazing…
Well, seeing as things have come to this, I might as well just tell you.
Oh, my…well, Thank you very much.
Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc….
Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries.
Pay careful attention to the files in each room.
The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.
Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library.
Look carefully at the numbers on each file.
There is a number at the beginning of each file name.
Look at the number on the files that don't belong in that library. Match the number with the letters in the title of the file.
If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and… well, you get the idea.
What do you mean the next hint? I've practically told you, didn't I?
…all right. Since this seems like a special case, I'll give you MY key card!
If you run into President Shinra, please don't tell him about this.
I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.
I never thought you'd get it on the first try…
Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, a promise is a promise. Take this, too.
Received "Elemental" Materia!
What…full already? Come back again when it's empty.
Received "Potion"!
Hmm. It appears you're not completely stupid.
Fine then, take this.
I see… For you…this might be best.
Then, this is for all of you.
Hoo boy! You finally got it?
You all really don't use your heads much, do you?
……What the hey. Here, just take it anyway.

When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be complete.
That must be why he took
Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some sort of stench coming from somewhere…
It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands.
Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files…
But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of being a secretary!
Come on, we're building the future of Mako!
…………………… Phew!
Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
We have the damage estimates for Sector 7.
Considering those factories we already set up and all the investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil…
The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is…
We're not rebuilding.
What?
We're leaving Sector 7 as it is.
And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.
…then the Ancients?
The Promised Land will soon be ours.
I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.
Palmer
Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space Program in the budget!
Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate increase.
Oh man!
Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence…
It'll be all right.
The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more.
Ha ha ha!
After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!
That dirty #$*$^
Hojo. How's the girl?
Hojo
As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18 %.
How long will the research take?
Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.
That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.
What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?
That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong… and yet has her weaknesses.
They were talking about AERIS…right?
I dunno.
Probably.
Let's follow 'em.
Scarlet
Something stinks…
President Shinra
That concludes our meeting.
Flush?
Climb up?
Get out of here
Hojo…huh…?
I remember him.
That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. CLOUD, don't you know him?
This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So…that's what he looks like…
Is this today's specimen?
Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
My precious specimen…
Precious specimen…?
Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
Jenova…
Jenova… Sephiroth's… So…they've brought it here.
CLOUD, be strong!
Did you see it?
See what?
It's moving……still alive?
Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.
Let's see… The specimen Hojo asked me for is…
That elevator back there is only to transport Specimens. You can't use it. It would be a lot easier if it led to the 68 Floor Research Lab.
AERIS? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?
We're taking AERIS back.
Outsiders……
Shoulda noticed it earlier, you…
There's so many frivolous things in this world.
Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.
The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?
Ugh.
That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.
Now, bring in the Specimen!
What do you think you're doin'?
Lending a helping hand to an endangered species… Both of them are on the brink of extinction…
If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.
…animal? That's terrible! AERIS is a human being!
You're gonna pay!
BARRET! Can't you do anything?
Awright!! Step back!
Stop!!
Wh…what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens…
This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
Now's our chance to get AERIS!
Thanks, CLOUD.
CLOUD…what's wrong?
…The elevator is moving.
Oh shit… We're surrounded.
He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.
It talked!?
I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss.
We'll take care of that monster.
What's your name?
Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish.
Come on!
AERIS, you all right?
She seems all right, …in many ways.
I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things.
What are you?
An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see.
…You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way.
CLOUD… so you did come for me.
I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard……
Now we've saved AERIS, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So let's get the hell outta here!
If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up in two groups.
I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Later! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator!
Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor!
No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do.
To prove it to you…here, this is the key card to the 68th Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?
Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Not that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
You don't have a Card Key
H, hey! What is it?
Rude
Would you press 'Up' please?
Turks! Must be a trap…
This must've been a real thrill for you… Did you enjoy it?
Ggh…
They got you, too?
In a safe place.
She's the last surviving Ancient…
Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history.
Cetra…that girl is a survivor of the Cetra?
Cetra, or the Ancients, will show us the way to the 'Promised Land'. I'm expecting a lot out of her.
The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
Even so, it's far too appealing not to pursue.
It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile.
…If the land is fertile…
then there's gotta be Mako!
Exactly. That is why our money making Mako Reactor is necessary.
The abundant Mako will flow out on its own.
That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory…
@$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power.
Well, that is all for our meeting.
Hold it! I got a lot to say to you!
If there's anything else… talk to my secretary.
Come on! Outta his way!
I wonder how BARRET is doing
I wonder how RED XIII is doing
I wonder how AERIS is doing
Let's just get some sleep
Psst (Can we get out?)
Psst (CLOUD, you're so brave!)
Psst (Don't give up!)
Hey!
AERIS is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.
The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.
I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.
Is that right?
The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.
Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy.
…and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.
I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin'new members!!
Me, TIFA, CLOUD… and AERIS too.
How 'bout you?
You're so damn boring.
…………Grandpa.
Grandpa!?  Ha, ha, ha…… Grandpa, hmm……ha, ha, ha……
What's so funny?
Nothin'……ha, ha
CLOUD, are you there?
AERIS!? You safe?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I knew that CLOUD would come for me.
Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?
The deal was for one date, right?
…………oh, I get it.
…!? TIFA! TIFA, you're there too!
EXCUSE me.
You know, AERIS. I have a question.
What?
Does the Promised Land really exist?
All I know is…
The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.
And……then…
The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.
…What does that mean?
More than words……I don't know.
…Speak with the Planet?
Just what does the Planet say?
It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
You hear it now?
I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is…my real mother.
Someday I'll get out of Midgar… Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land.
…That's what mom said.
I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but…
What's happened?
The door's open… When did it open?
TIFA… Wake up!
Something's wrong. Look outside.
This's kinda eerie…
I wonder what happened…
He should have the key on him…
Come on, TIFA, get AERIS. I'll go help BARRET and the others.
…What happened?
BARRET, RED XIII …come with me. Something's wrong.
How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
The hell's goin' on!?
No human could've done this.
I'll go on ahead.
I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!
Come on, let's follow RED XIII!
Jenova Specimen… Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
It looks like it leads up…
He's dead… The head of Shinra is dead…
Then this sword must be…
Sephiroth's!!
…Sephiroth is alive?
…Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra!
Uh!
P, p, p, please, don't kill me!
What happened?
Se…Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
Yeah, I saw him! With my own eyes!
You really saw him?
Uh! Would I lie at a time like this!? I heard his voice, too!
Um, he said something about not letting us have the Promised Land.
Then does that mean
the Promised Land really does exist and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
So he's a good guy then?
Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!
It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!
Who's that?
Vice President Rufus. The President's son.
I only know his name.
I heard that he'd been assigned somewhere else for a long time…
I wonder what sort of person he is?
I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
Rufus
So… So Sephiroth was actually here. …By the way,
just who are you?
I'm CLOUD, ex-SOLDIER, First Class!
I'm from AVALANCHE!
Me too!
A flower girl from the slums.
A Research Specimen.
What a crew.
Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.
You're only President 'cause yer old man died!
Correct. I'll let you hear my inauguration speech.
…Father tried to control the world with money and that worked for him.
The people believed that Shinra would protect them.
Work at Shinra, get your pay. If terrorists attack, the Shinra army will help you.
It looked perfect on the outside.
But, I do things differently.
I'll control the world with fear. It's too much to do it like my old man.
A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste good money on them.
(!) I'm different from my father. (!)
He likes to make speeches just like his father.
Get AERIS outta the building!
I'll explain later! BARRET! This is the real crisis for the Planet!
The hell's that supposed to mean?
I'll explain later! Just take my word for now! I'll go after I take care of him!
Alright, CLOUD!
Why do you want to fight me?
You want the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
That's right.
Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
…Whatever, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!
I see. I guess we won't be allies.

Then, I'm going!
I'll go, too. There are things I need to know.
About the Ancients?
…Many things.
I guess it's good bye, Midgar.
Yeah, she should be
Hmm, I don't know
She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. …Maybe it's for the best.
Stop it, CLOUD! I'm worried, too.
You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar…
Really? Are you worried?
It's dangerous. Are you sure you want to go?
A little…no, maybe a lot. But I have a bodyguard, right?
I thought you'd say that!
…I guess this is the start of our journey…
It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?

Then…
Let's stay here for a while
Let's go!
To the Northeast, there's a town called Kalm.
The food at the Inn's good. Why don't we head there first?
You're right. I've heard about that town before. CLOUD?
About Sephiroth, and about the crisis of the Planet…
You're right. We need to know where Sephiroth went.
We need a leader for our journey. Course that could only be me.
You think so?
I think it should be CLOUD.
^#$^%…alright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.
