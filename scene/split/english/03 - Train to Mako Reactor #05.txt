Last train out of Sector 8 Station.
Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard.
Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM,
Huh? This is my house, so make yourselves at home.
Hey!! What's going on here?
Oops, uh, n, nothing…
Please don't make any trouble.
…mumble…grumble… (…Reactor's blown to bits… …Bad things one after another… …What a day!)
Please!! Don't bother the other passengers.
This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy…
You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?
The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums.
…Blowing up a Reactor… they sure put some thought into this one.
They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
YO!
This ain't no private car!! So split up!!
…Hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck?
You say sumthin' ?
I said, 'you say sumthin'!?
Now look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden.
What's goin' on?
DAMN!!
It..it's empty because of… g, guys like you…
YYY…YIPES!!
You…you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.
Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today.
You work for Shinra?
Shinra Manager
I won't give in to violence… and I'm not giving you my seat either!
BARRET!!
&$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!
So, what are we gonna do now?
@#$%! The hell you so calm? You're bustin' up my rhythm!
Huh?  Wait a minute!
Did we make a terrorist threat?
What are you talking about? Right about now, AVALANCHE is famous.
Heh heh… Famous…
Looks like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.
CLOUD
So what's our next target?
Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!
Alright…I'll tell ya!
Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.
It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.
Which Shinra is very proud of.
We can't use our fake ID's anymore…
Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines.
Arrival time at Sector 4 Station is 11:45.
That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.
Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.
Got it!?
What do we do until then?
The hell do I care whatcha do? Just siddown an' shu'up.
Sorry, but I have a thing against sitting down in trains.
@#$%! Do whatever you want!
What do we do after we jump?
Yo, CLOUD!
Yo, Mr. Know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right!
So let's hear YOUR explanation!
I'll help, too.
@#$%! I don't know even why you came!
Oh, BARRET! Are you mad because I'm not paying enough attention to you?
@#$%!!
CLOUD, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.
Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already…
It's all right. Come a little closer.
That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
Type A Security Alert!!
Unidentified passengers confirmed…
A search of all cars will be conducted!
Repeat!!
Type A Security Alert!!
Unidentified passengers confirmed…
A search of all cars will be conducted!
What's happening?
What's goin' on?!
Jessie
We're in trouble.
I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
@#$%! Someone blew it…
Let's go! Keep it up!
C'mon!! Hurry your slow ass up! That's it, huh?
Oh well…
We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!
We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.
Hmmm? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house.
I'm impressed.
Hm? You'd talk to me even now?
I'm really impressed. Here's a little something as a reward.
Received "Phoenix Down"!
If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?
Shinra Manager
Waaaaah!!
Don't…don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man…!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this…)

Jessie
Ugh! I'm not sure…
C'mon, this ain't no joke!
Biggs
Hurry!
Wedge
They're locking the door, sir!
Biggs
We'll execute it just as we planned it.
Wedge
I'm goin' first, sir! Let's switch to Plan 2!
What do you want me to do?
Jessie
Just run!
Changing to Plan 2!
Damn!! I guess there's no other way…
We gonna kick some ass!
What!? That's it!?
That didn't do anything!
We'll jump from here!! Follow me, you 'spensive leech!!
Phew---! Be strong!

Hey… You guys are too rowdy.
Well, just calm down.
Yes, it's really something. It's always like this.
Hey, yo! Jus' keep the hell outta my face!
Hyu---n!! Hyu---n!!
Does this mean that we're in a major bind?
Gosh!! You're adults, but you're acting like kids.
Please behave while you're in the train.
Huh?
The hell?
Do you want this?
Yeah…
My mistake
Wow! I won't even charge you…
What? Don't get used to it though.
Wha-t? Let me know when you need me.
Received "Hi-Potion"!
Wha-t? You sure are greedy.

Alright! We clear!?
Jessie
Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for!
But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!
Damn, man!! Explain it right!
Jessie
You want an explanation? OK!! Let me.
Jessie
This train's security system is the old Shinra A system.
Once it identifies an illegal ID, the system automatically locks down each car.
It'll stay locked until it gets to the station, where Shinra guards will be waiting.
Jessie
But it's an old system, we can get past it.
If we move from car to car to the front, we should be able to go on as planned.
Jessie
The second detection scan should be coming up pretty soon. Let's go to the next car!
Jessie
Oh no!
Jessie
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault that we didn't clear the ID scan.
I modified the ID card for CLOUD and that's what made the sensors go off.
I did my best, but it just didn't work.
Jessie
I'll make a better one next time.
I'll head back to the hideout first and work on research and development.
…Oh, man…
The hell!? So this is as far as we go?
We were almost there.
We're gonna jump off here!! Follow me!!
Don't worry! Don't worry!

Shu'up!!  Don't talk to me! You're gonna mess me up!
…heave…breathe…
urrrrgh!!
Shhhhhhh! Not now!
OK, already!
Johnny
Later…Goodbye…Adios, Midgar!!
Johnny
sob…
Hee hee!!
Yesss!!
urrrrrrrg
…Nowhere to run…
By any chance…
Busted?
Huh?
That's right
I'm SO sorry. I'll give it back…
OK, then. That's that.
Any idea what happened?
All I know is, when I woke up, the 3 of us were butt-naked!
But I guess you couldn't relate…
That scary broad made me take the bomb.
Of course I couldn't very well refuse her!
Brrrrrr…
It's terrible. Who'd expect underwear bandits in this day and age?
What the hell?
Hmph!
I know what you want to say.
Here, take it!

…Scary…huh.
Too late for that now. Why'd you come along anyway?
Because…
Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!
Yeah!! I've made up my mind!
Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!
You don't care if I go first?
A leader always stays till the end.
Don't worry 'bout me, just go!
Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!
It's only the beginnin' of the mission!
Wedge
Guess who? It's me, Wedge!
Looks like things were a success.
Wedge
I look just like my little brother in these clothes…
I wonder how everyone is now?
Jessie
It's me, Jessie. How do I look, CLOUD?
Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?
Yeah…
Not now
…You look great, just like a man.
Just concentrate on our plan.
Jessie
Yay!! I'm so happy …I think?
Jessie
You're right, sorry.
Biggs
I always wanted to dress up like this.
Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!!
…Do something!
Later! You take care of the rest!

You're the AVALANCHE!
Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go any further.
Shinra security guards are there. …We've got to turn back.
A terrorist attack!
AVALANCHE is attacking!
Intruders!
More security's coming. It's dangerous to stay here.
Run
Stay here
That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!
Yo, CLOUD, what're we gonna do?
Look inside
Go down
Don't go
Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.
CLOUD, you jus' gotta go.
Go down
Don't go
But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills.
Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
…Doesn't seem to be anything that'll get us stuck in this duct.
After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by a security sensor.
Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back.
Good, so far everything's going as planned.
That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught…
Oh man…… We were forced to get this far out.
Don't let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.
They probably don't know we sneaked in yet. We'll be at the reactor in no time.
We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.
Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!
Jessie
I'm sorry.
Wedge
CLOUD, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.
Biggs
We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.
CLOUD, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!
Jessie
Next time, I'll give you something better.
I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it.
Jessie
The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.
Jessie
I modified your ID card… And that's what did it…
Jessie
I did my best… But I failed.
The reactor's just down this tunnel!
Papa…
Sephiroth!?
Did Sephiroth do this to you?
Sephiroth…SOLDIER… Mako Reactors…Shinra…
I hate them all!
Damn man, get a hold of yourself!
You all right?
…TIFA.
Mmm?
No…forget… Come on, let's hurry!
I know. You're my chaperone, right?
Damn straight.
TIFA's old friend… That ain't good enough.
Let's hurry, CLOUD.
Alright, let's go.

[Blin66_1 is missing, so I’ve had to piece this together as best I could]
Jessie said we all have to push the button at once.
No good. Let's try it again.
No.5 Reactor
This way!
Shinra soldiers!?
No.5 Reactor
$#%&! What the hell's goin' on?
…A trap…
Pres…President Shinra?
Why is the President here?
President Shinra
Hmm… So you all must be… What was it?
AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! So you're President Shinra, huh?
Long time no see, sir.
President Shinra
…Long time no see? Oh…you.
You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes…
Tell me, traitor… what was your name?
CLOUD.
President Shinra
Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember everyone's name.
Unless you become another Sephiroth.
President Shinra
Aah, Sephiroth… He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant.
Sephiroth?
Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
President Shinra
And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you…
VERMIN!? That's all you can say? VERMIN!?
Shinra're the VERMIN for killing the Planet! Guess that'd make you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!
President Shinra
…You are beginning to bore me.
I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me… I have a dinner I must attend.
Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
President Shinra
But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all.
What's that noise?!
The hell is that!?
President Shinra
Now then, if you'll excuse me.
Wait, President!
President Shinra
Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him.
I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments.
Help, CLOUD!
THIS is from SOLDIER?
Yo, CLOUD! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!
No way! It's just a machine.
I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!
It's gonna blow! Let's go, TIFA!
BARRET! Can't you do something?
Not a damn thing.
CLOUD! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!
I know, TIFA…
Hey, you gonna be alright?
(Be strong)
(I don't know if I can hold on)
…
You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of TIFA!
…Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
Stop talkin' like this is the end!
OK, hold on!
Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it on your own.
BARRET…
&#%^! Can't hold on much longer. BARRET, hurry!
…Techno-soldier?
