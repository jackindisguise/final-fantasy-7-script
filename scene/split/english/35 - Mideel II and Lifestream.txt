She's always there right by his side. She must really love him.
Even at a time like this You've got to be strong like her.
Sometimes he mumbles about numbers… I wonder what it means?
She's finally beginning to look a little tired… I hope she's all right.
No change in his condition, yet she stays right by his side. It must be tough on her.
If she keeps this up she's going to get sick…
I'm sorry… But your friend's condition remains unchanged…
You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence.
A billion mirror fragments… small…light…
taken…angel's… singing voices… …Xeno…gears…
…what… What number….am I?
CLOUD… I don't understand a word.
I'm such a fool…… I thought I could do something to help…
…It's no use…I don't understand a thing, CLOUD.
What should I do? What if you never recover for the rest of your life?
Oh no… It's…
…coming…. They're…coming…!!
What did you say, CLOUD!?
Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?
This is bad!! This one's big!
Eyaaah! I hate earthquakes!!
Oh god… The tremors are getting worse.
Wait a minute, CLOUD.
Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere?
Hmm…It might be safer to move to an open area.
Don't you worry about a thing, CLOUD…
I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!
No! The structure can't take it!! * Hurry!
Ready CLOUD? We're leaving now!!
Well anyhow… Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you get some rest?
OK! Perfect! Well then, take care.
Damn!! That &%$^%$ Weapon!!
Of all the times to show up!
OK then, come on!! You &$^%$!
You &^$#&$#  ! You tryin' to escape?
Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I woudda smashed him…
Looks like the Lifestream's settled down now too.
Just a little more and I would have beaten him.
It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well.
No matter how many lives I get, it ain't enough!
Looks like the Lifestream's back under control, too.
I swear, next time, that guy's dead meat!
Well at least the Lifestream's back to normal.
Hmm… Looks like escape is its best skill.
And the Lifestream also appears to be normal.
Damn, you gotta be kiddin'!!
Th, this's bad! The main stream is kickin' up!!
Somethin' way bigger than that last one is on its way!!
No good!! Get outta here!!
But what about TIFA and CLOUD!?
But what about CLOUD and the others?
Goddammit!! Don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! Don't know when that stream'll blow…
There's no time, hurry!!
TIFA!! CLOUD!! Get outta here!!
Wh, where am I?* What's happening? I…
Where's CLOUD? CLOUD, where are you!?
Huh…what? Who…?
Who is it? I can't hear…
Wait a minute! I know nothing about that!
No! It's not me! I'd never do anything like that!!
No! Stop it!! Stay back!
Somebody…help! Please!!
CLOUD,help me!!
Eyaaaaghh!!
… Where am I?
What is it, CLOUD? What is this?
You're searching, aren't you CLOUD? Searching…for yourself…
Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it… your…subconscious?
I can help, too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back!
But… Where do we start?
It connects… to Nibelheim?
That's right…It's probably best to start from there…
Let's go have a look, CLOUD. I know it's not easy… I'll be here for you…
The gates of Nibelheim… Five years ago, Sephiroth passed through these gates…
And… That's how it all started…
That starry night at the well… The promise we made then… What if that memory was all a lie?
…A sealed up secret…wish…
Tender feelings… that no one can ever know…
If I could just get stronger… Then even TIFA would have to notice me…
So that was it?
Sorry, CLOUD.
If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner…
It's not your fault, TIFA.
But, I remember back when we were eight!
That's it! Now I know!
You weren't created five years ago.
My childhood memories weren't all made up!
Hang in there CLOUD! Just a little longer! You've almost found the real you!
Let's go back to Nibelheim again!
The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the palm of our hands.
There's nothing… I can say.
You must find the answer yourself.
If you can't, then…
Take your time, CLOUD. Slowly…little by little, OK?
You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth wasn't…CLOUD?
Don't hurry, CLOUD… Don't answer too quickly.
Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back… Slowly…little by little…
Right…like the sky that night… the heavens were filled with stars…
A promise under a starry sky… But what if that was just a memory TIFA imagined?
You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth to Nibelheim wasn't CLOUD?
CLOUD, what about your other memories?
No, not memories.
A memory is something that is consciously recalled, right?
That's why sometimes it can be mistaken or wrong.
It's different from a memory locked deep within your heart.
That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory…
That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?
If I say something, you can't remember it.
But if you say something, and I remember it, too… Then we'll know that's a memory.
Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you…
Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?
I always thought it was a sudden decision.
…I was devastated. …I wanted to be noticed.
I thought if I got stronger someone would notice.
Someone to notice you? …Who?
Who? You know who!* …You, that's who.
You…
Me? Why!?
TIFA…Did you forget… about those days?
Look…I…
I'm sorry… But what are you talking about?
No…it's all right. You were having a hard time back then.
You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me then.
It's important to me… I hate to say it, but it's a very important memory.
Do you want to see it?
Oh…wait!
Come on, hurry.
Do you know where this window goes to, TIFA?
Fine…I'll go.
Then…this is goodbye, TIFA. Until we meet again…
Uh…* Ah, uh…
Uh…% TIFA…
Oh, CLOUD! It's really you, isn't it?
Yeah…TIFA… We finally…meet again…
You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!
Krgh!
CLOUD!? Are you all right!?
V, voice…their…
I see. We're… in the Lifestream, aren't we?
Everyone's waiting.
Let's go back, CLOUD. Back to everyone…
Yeah, I guess so… Come on, TIFA. Let's go home…
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me.
My father…
CLOUD…look.
Here's the well…
And that's Gramps' Inn, too.
The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?
This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?
It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this is…our Nibelheim.
Five years ago…two men from SOLDIER came…
Sephiroth and… a young and vibrant soldier.
Can you tell me again what happened?
No, CLOUD.
I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you …something terrible might happen.
But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.
You weren't here. CLOUD did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.
I…waited. But, CLOUD…never came.
The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person…
Five Years ago…I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.
So this is…the Great Sephiroth?
But to tell the truth, I thought he was very cold.
I remember a foreboding about him.
This is your hometown, right?
From the beginning…OK?
Try and remember, CLOUD.
…I was wearing these clothes.
That's you, too. You were so small then…
…and cute.
Sephiroth once said…
CLOUD made up his memories by listening to my stories…
Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it.
That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just CLOUD and I. We talked at the well…
He remembered our promise too…
That's why I kept thinking you were the real CLOUD.
I still believe you're the CLOUD from Nibelheim…
But you don't believe in yourself…
These memories aren't enough.
…I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?
Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there.
No one crosses that mountain alive…
How 'bout those that died?
Did mama pass through the mountains?
I'm going!
I don't remember the path I walked.
TIFA missed her step. I ran to her…but didn't make it in time.
We both fell off the cliff.
Back then, I only scarred my knees but…
CLOUD! Why'd you bring TIFA to a place like this!
What the hell's the matter with you!?
What if she dies!?
TIFA was in a coma for seven days.
We all thought she wouldn't make it.
If only I could've saved her…
I was so angry… at myself for my weakness.
Ever since then, I felt TIFA blamed me…
I went out of control… I'd get into fights with anyone.
That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth.
I thought if I were strong like Sephiroth, then…
CLOUD's coming!
You think he wants to come in?
Was that the first day you came into my room?
…that's right.
We lived next to each other. But I really didn't know you that well.
I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close…
I…really didn't know CLOUD that well.
That's why I was a bit surprised when CLOUD asked me to come out to the well.
TIFA was so popular and I never played much with the others…
But, but listen! After CLOUD left town, I thought about him a lot.
I thought, I wonder how CLOUD is doing?
I wondered if he was able to get into SOLDIER?
I even started reading the newspaper, just to see if CLOUD was in any of the articles.
I want…to see…Mom…
My room?
It was my first time there.
Was it?
I only used to look up at it from outside.
Hey, look!
Now that you mention it…I don't recall you ever being in my room…
TIFA always used to have her own group.
…That's right.
I thought they were all…stupid.
What!?
You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing.
But we were children then.
…I know. I was the stupid one.
I really wanted to play with everyone, but you never let me in the group.
Then later…I started thinking I was different…
That I was different from those immature kids.
That then…maybe…
Just maybe, they would invite me in.
I thought that might happen, so I hung around…
I was so prejudiced. …And weak.
That night I asked TIFA to come out to the well…
I thought to myself TIFA would never come…that she hated me.
…It was so sudden. I was a bit…surprised.
But…
It's true we weren't THAT close, but…
After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.
I started reading the newspapers, thinking I might see an article about you.
Thanks, TIFA.
Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy.
Huh?
What happened on this day? Was it a special day?
This was the day…
TIFA's mother…
The day Mom died…
CLOUD, wait.
Where are you going?
……The reactor……?
To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!
Yeah…this is…me.
Not in SOLDIER, just a common grunt.
I…never made it as a member of SOLDIER.
I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, but…
I was so embarrassed… I didn't want to see anybody…
Zack
Hey CLOUD. If you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask off?
Settle down.
I'm…
Hey! It's CLOUD!
Za…ck…Zac…k. Zack…
You remembered!!
That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!
Then, where were you, CLOUD?
CLOUD… Did you…see it all?
I saw…everything…
Aaarrrgh…who…who are you?
Mom… TIFA…My town…give it back…
I had so much respect for you… I admired you…
That's what happened…
…You were there.
You were watching me.
…You came. …You kept your promise.
So you really did come when I was in trouble!
Sorry… I didn't get there…sooner…
It's all right…CLOUD.
Just like you.
CLOUD… Kill Sephiroth…
Don't…push it…
…It can't be!
Yo! You alright!? TIFA!?
u…unn…?
BARRET… You came back. I…
CLOUD… Where is he?
Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.
BARRET…I… When I was in the Lifestream, I saw the real CLOUD.
I mean, I didn't really find him. CLOUD…he found himself…
Alright, I know… I shouldn't have doubted.
But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.
People have so many things pent up inside of themselves…
So many things they can never forget.
Strange…isn't it?
Yo, TIFA! Snap outta it!!
TIFA!?
CLOUD, I was deeply moved by your story!
I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you feel, CLOUD!
No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!
Thank you for a job well done!
Oh…oh… CLOUD…
Your command?
(PHS)
(SAVE)
(HP/MP restored!)
Everyone…I'm sorry. I don't know what to say…
Don't say anything, CLOUD. All you've been doing is apologizing.
I never was in SOLDIER.
I made up the story about what happened five years ago and my being in SOLDIER.
I left my village looking for glory, but never made it into SOLDIER…
I was so ashamed of being so weak. Then I heard this story from my friend Zack…
And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life…
And I continued to play the charade as if it were true.
Illusion, huh? Pretty damn strong for an illusion.
Physically, I'm built like someone in SOLDIER.
Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult. It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.
You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.
Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells…
For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER. It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.
But weak people…like me, get lost in the whole thing.
The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.
Everyone knew that. I'm…CLOUD.
…the master of my own illusionary world.
But I can't remain trapped in an illusion anymore… I'm going to live my life without pretending.
You're sure messed up, CLOUD!
That means he ain't no different from before!
By the way, CLOUD. What are you going to do now?
Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?
…I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us.
That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this thing.
Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the Planet!?
It's like you always told me, BARRET.
Oh, uh, you mean that!
What? I don't understand!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train!
Let's do it, CLOUD!
Are you okay?
…I hate moving vehicles. I always get sick.
That's too bad…
But that's okay. That's the real me.
Ahoy! This here's Mideel. As you can see, this used to be a quiet hot springs town.
Everything's gone now but in a way, I'm kinda glad everything's cleaned out. Feels better this way, ho, ho.
Have you seen my husband? He disappeared during the big earthquake and I haven't seen him since.
I thought he'd be in the store… You don't think he got through that door and went to another country on the other side, do you?
That's all just a dream… That could never really happen. Heh…
Welcome! We always welcome cash! What can I do for you today?
I'm sorry. Our stock isn't so great now… But that's just the way it is here.
If you're looking for other items, why don't you check out the other stores?
Welcome. Just what you need at a time like this--a shop of rest and relaxation. What ya want?
Thank you! We don't have many goods but you come again, please.
Hee, hee. Welcome It's here. The day's finally come! Your day to shop!!
Do we have items and weapons!? Well, I should say so. And here's a bargain! What would you say to 50% off everything?
Just kidding. Even I wouldn't do something like that. Now what can I do for you today?
Show me your items
Show me some weapons
Show me some Materia
Let me outta here
Thank you. Come again!
Hey, you feelin' all better now? That's good, real good. Now don't overdo yourself like that again, hear?
Isn't the Lifestream a strange thing?
When I die, I wonder if I'll float along in the middle of a warm gentle stream like this?
Hmph! You!? How did you get over your Mako poisoning?
It's absolutely amazing… I am so glad for you! Looks like your friends' wishes came true.
You can see for yourself what things are like, but at least no one was seriously hurt. We're just very unhappy now.
You probably don't remember, but you know that girl that watched over you for so long when you were sick?
You'd better be good to her. If you don't, you'll be sorry. Believe me!
[DOES NOT EXIST]
Who's this? Say, why are you being so friendly?
Oh, so this is it? You like the Mimmet Greens, don't you?
Don't give it any!
Sorry, peewee But I can't give you any.
Well, I guess it won't hurt. Here, shorty, eat up.
Ha, ha. You're pretty cute. Here, I'm gonna tickle you a bit.
Hey, don't surprise me like that! I thought you were dead!
Well anyhow… Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?
Oh great. Now I've got to find another job… I guess I might as well make my side job as an accessory seller into my regular job.
Well, since you're already here, why don't you buy something to take back with you?
