Oh, here!!
Put this on.
It smells a little, but don't complain.
You look pretty good with that.
Yo! Old guy! We at Midgar yet?
Shaddap! You're lucky I even gave you a ride!
Hah!
What're you gonna do once we get to Midgar?
I know what I'm gonna do.
I got a place I can crash for a while…
No wait, the mother lives there too.
Guess that's out.
Yep…gotta change my plans!
Hmm…
No matter what I do, I need some money first…
…Hey, wanna start a business? Now what could we do?
Hey, CLOUD.
Think there's anything I'd be good at?
Hey old guy!
What do you think I'd be good at?
What're you yappin' about? You're still young ain't ya?
Young folks should try everything!
You gotta pay your dues while you're young. Go out and look for what you really want.
Yeah, whatever…
Find my own way?
Try everything… That's easy for him to say.
Of course!
I got more brains and skill than most other guys!
That settles it!
I'm gonna become a mercenary!
Hey…didn't you even hear a word I said?
Yeah! Thanks Pops!
No, wait…you got it all wrong.
Listen, I'm gonna become a mercenary and that's that.
Boring stuff, dangerous stuff, anything for money.
I'm gonna be rich!
So, CLOUD? What are YOU gonna do?
U…uhhh…
Just kidding… I won't leave you hanging like that.
We're friends, right?
Mercenaries. CLOUD. That's what you an' me are gonna be.
Mercenaries. CLOUD. That's what you an' me are gonna be.
Understand, CLOUD?
What do you want to do with him?

Forget it. Just leave him.
