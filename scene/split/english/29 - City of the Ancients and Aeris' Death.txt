Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.
What do you want?
Where is the City of the Ancients?
Do you know where AERIS is?
What are you doing?
What do you want?
Have you seen Sephiroth?
What are you doing?
Oh, the man in a black cape. He was looking for the Temple of the Ancients.
The Temple of the Ancients?
Thanks
It's way down south. It's on the other side of this town and the inland sea.
It's the pyramid rising out of the forest.
How do you get in?
That's enough
You'll need the Keystone.
What's a Keystone?
Oh, yeah, I know
Just like it sounds. A rock that's a key. I heard that some rich guy has it.
You need something?
Are you going to run away??
What are you doing?
Through fossils, we already know everything that happened on this Planet since the beginning.
Now, we want to see the rest on to the end of the Planet… It's a mixed feeling…
The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City.
Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went into the Sleeping Forest anyway.
Excavating is great. It's like a history of the Planet told in the land.
This town's motto is not to think about anything.
Just live. Eat, work, and sleep.
It's pretty hard not to think about anything.
Want to buy something?
Want to buy something?
I want the Lunar Harp
Don't want anything
Thanks! Now, the forest will awaken.
The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could excavate it for you if you want us to.
Start diggin'
I want to buy something
Not right now
Other than the Lunar Harp, What else do you want us to dig for?
Lunar Harp
Good treasure
Normal treasure
This has already been excavated.
All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where you want us to dig!
Everything already excavated is in the box next to the tent.
The memory of this planet is buried layer by layer in this geological stratum. Kind of romantic, don't you think?
The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right now the forest is asleep. Anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, gets confused. You can go in, but you may never come out…
But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a black cape went in. You think they'll be all right?
You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp.
Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you.
The girl in pink who just went in used a Lunar Harp to get through.
I want a Lunar Harp
Not interested
Ask the guy in the tent below.
We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We use bombs to make earthquakes, and then check the sound waves given off by the tremors.
Please push [SWITCH] to
set staff in position.
Order a search (100 gil)
Done
Could not position the staff,
due to a lack of funds.
Press [SWITCH] to ignite the
bomb for the search.
The staff member will calculate
the tremors and dig up the buried item.
The dig point is where
the staff's line
of vision meets.
Move to the dig point
and press [SWITCH] to select.
The staff will dig for the item.
Now, the staff will dig here. The result will be placed in the treasure box overnight.
Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that.
It, it's scary…
Just a while ago, a young girl asked me the same things.
Then the entrance to the forest made a funny sound, like 'Grrrrrrgh!'.
I thought that maybe I could do it, too.
Please, let me in!
While ago, a man in black came and said this as he went into the forest.
Nnnnnnghaah!
The Sleeping Forest awoke…
CLOUD
This place…!
CLOUD
So that's……the capital of the Ancients The Forgotten City'.
CLOUD
AERIS is in that 'City'.
CLOUD
…Ugh.
CLOUD
…Words of the Ancients?
CLOUD
…No good. I can't understand.
CLOUD
…Ugh, again?
CLOUD
This stream of consciousness… Could this be the words of the Ancients…?
TIFA
Eyaaaa!
TIFA
…Consciousness of the Ancients?
TIFA
…I'm sorry. …I can't…understand.
TIFA
Eaayy!? Again?
TIFA
It speaks directly to my mind… Is this the Consciousness of the Ancients?
CID
Whoa…!
CID
What the hell's this?
CID
Hey Ancients, I don't even have a clue what you're trying to say to me.
CID
Whoa, @#$%! Not again!
CID
Who is it? Who's trying to peek into my mind?
Is it the Consciousness of the Ancients?
BARRET
Hey, there's a bed.
TIFA
Do you think the people who used to live here used it?
RED XIII
Look, there's a bed here.
CID
Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable.
YUFFIE
How COOL! I can't believe we found such a soft bed in a dive like this.
CAIT SITH
We're in luck. There's a bed in here.
VINCENT
I wonder if the owners used this?
BARRET
Yo, CLOUD. Let's take a break here.
TIFA
Shall we take a break here?
RED XIII
Hey, let's rest a bit. I'm tired…
CID
I'm beat. Why don't we get some rest?
YUFFIE
Come on--, let's rest for a while--- I don't want to walk anymore…
CAIT SITH
Why don't we catch some ZZZs?…
VINCENT
Maybe we should take a short nap?
Here's a bed.
Get some rest?
Yes
No
CLOUD
I feel it…
CLOUD
AERIS is here. …and so is Sephiroth.
CLOUD
…It's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul.
BARRET
CLOUD, what is it?
TIFA
CLOUD…what's wrong?
RED XIII
What's wrong? Are you sick?
CID
Do you know what TIME it is!?
YUFFIE
Hey---, CLOUD. What's your problem?
CAIT SITH
What's wrong? What time is it…?
VINCENT
…What's wrong?
BARRET
Wh, what! Sephiroth!?
TIFA
You're saying it's not just AERIS, but Sephiroth, too?
RED XIII
What! Sephiroth's here too!?
CID
Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?
YUFFIE
No way---! Sephiroth wasn't invited!
CAIT SITH
Are you serious, CLOUD!?
VINCENT
…If that's true, then we're in for it.
BARRET
How do you know that?
TIFA
But how can you tell?
RED XIII
How did you find out?
CID
Hey, how do you know!?
YUFFIE
Wh…why? How can you tell that kind of stuff?
CAIT SITH
But how can you tell that?
VINCENT
…How did you find that out?
BARRET
Then, we better get up offa our lazy asses!!
TIFA
If that's true, then we've got to hurry! We've got to get to AERIS!
RED XIII
Wh,…what should we do? We must hurry to her!
CID
@#$$, CLOUD. We can't be sittin' around on our asses.
YUFFIE
That means it's pretty bad …doesn't it?
CAIT SITH
If that's true, then we're in for it! We have to find AERIS fast!
VINCENT
If that's true, we should hurry. Something terrible could happen at any moment.
CLOUD
…Right. Let's hurry and find AERIS.
CLOUD
No time to be sleeping.
CLOUD
No time to think about it.
CLOUD
AERIS's voice…… Coming from there?
CLOUD
We have to find AERIS.
BARRET
Hey yo! Wait up.
BARRET
I hate to say it, but I'm beat. Isn't there anywhere to rest.
TIFA
Hey, hey CLOUD.
TIFA
I'm…I'm so tired. Can't we find somewhere to rest?
RED XIII
Wait!
RED XIII
I'm exhausted. Let me get some rest somewhere.
CID
H…ey, CLOUD
CID
I gotta get some more rest. Let me catch a snooze somewhere around here.
YUFFIE
Ahhh--- I can't go another step!!
YUFFIE
I'm so----o tired! If you don't get me to a bed, I'm not taking another step!
CAIT SITH
Wa------it!
CAIT SITH
I'm exhausted. I'm sorry, but please let me rest somewhere.
VINCENT
Wait, CLOUD.
VINCENT
…I'm tired.
BARRET
That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find AERIS.
TIFA
If we continue this way, we'll end up in the Northern Mountains. AERIS isn't over there, right?
RED XIII
That road leads to the Northern Mountains. We have to go the other way to find AERIS.
CID
You thinkin' of going skiing? If we wanna find AERIS, we go THAT way!
YUFFIE
We're looking for AERIS, right! Then why are you heading for the mountains!? What a dork!
CAIT SITH
CLOUD, uh that's the road to the Northern Mountains.
AERIS is waiting, let's go find her.
VINCENT
This is the road to the Northern Mountains. Don't you want to find AERIS?
CLOUD
AERIS?
BARRET
CLOUD!
TIFA
CLOUD!
RED XIII
CLOUD!
CAIT SITH
CLOUD!
YUFFIE
CLOUD!
CID
CLOUD!
VINCENT
CLOUD!
BARRET
Stop it!!
TIFA
Stop!
RED XIII
Please stop that!
CAIT SITH
What're you doing!
YUFFIE
Sto----p!
CID
Dumb #^%@!
VINCENT
Stop it!
CLOUD
Ugh…what are you making me do?
AERIS
…stay…back…
CLOUD
…AERIS.
CLOUD
This can't be real!
Sephiroth
Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's energy.
All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for me over the snowy fields.
Sephiroth
There, I will become a new being by uniting with the Planet. As will this girl…
CLOUD
…Shut up.
CLOUD
The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing.
CLOUD
AERIS is gone.
AERIS will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry…or get angry…
CLOUD
What about us…what are WE supposed to do?
CLOUD
What is this pain?
CLOUD
My fingers are tingling. My mouth is dry. My eyes are burning!
Sephiroth
What are you talking about? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings now?
CLOUD
Of course! What do you think I am!?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…… Stop acting as if you are sad.
And there's no need to act as if you're angry either.
Sephiroth
Because, CLOUD. You are…
Jenova
Because, you are…a puppet.
Jenova
You are…
CLOUD
I'm…a puppet?
CLOUD
Everyone‚listen to me.
CLOUD
I'm CLOUD‚ex-SOLDIER‚ born in Nibelheim.
CLOUD
I came to settle up with Sephiroth.
BARRET
What're ya tryin' to say?
TIFA
…What's going on?
RED XIII
…Hmm?
CID
I heard that before.
YUFFIE
Why now?
CAIT SITH
Why're you being so formal? Is something wrong?
VINCENT
…You're right.
CLOUD
I came here by my own free will… Or so I thought.
However…
CLOUD
…To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself.
CLOUD
…There is a part of me that I don't understand.
That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth.
CLOUD
If you hadn't stopped me, AERIS might have been…
…There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me.
CLOUD
That's why I should quit this journey.
Before I do something terrible.
CLOUD
But I am going.”
He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed AERIS‚and is now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive…Sephiroth.
CLOUD
I… I must go on.
CLOUD
…I have a favor to ask of you.
CLOUD
Will you all come with me?
CLOUD
…to save me from doing something terrible.
BARRET
…I dunno‚man…
TIFA
…But‚CLOUD
RED XIII
…All right‚CLOUD.
CID
Well‚we'll face it when it happens.
YUFFIE
Leave it to me!
CAIT SITH
Watch you?…… We're all in this together!
VINCENT
…I guess so.
CLOUD
I don't know how AERIS tried to save the planet from the Meteor.
And I guess now, we'll never know.
CLOUD
But!
CLOUD
We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses it.
CLOUD
Let's go.
CLOUD
Everyone, listen to me.
CLOUD
I am CLOUD, born in Nibelheim and formerly of SOLDIER.
CLOUD
I came here to settle up with Sephiroth.
TIFA
…What's wrong?
BARRET
…yeah, so?
RED XIII
…Huh?
YUFFIE
What hit you so suddenly?
VINCENT
…Yes.
CID
I've heard all this before.
CLOUD
I came here on my own will…… or at least that's what I thought. But…
CLOUD
To be honest… I'm afraid of myself.
CLOUD
There's a part of me I don't understand.
Like when I gave away the Black Materia.
CLOUD
And if you all hadn't stopped me, …AERIS might have…
CLOUD
…It's something inside me.
CLOUD
That is why, maybe I shouldn't go on with this journey.
I may do something terrible.
CLOUD
But, I AM going on.
CLOUD
Five years ago, he burned down my hometown, then he took AERIS.
And now he's trying to destroy the Planet. I won't let him get away with it.
CLOUD
…I must go on.
CLOUD
But…I have a favor to ask of you.”
CLOUD
…Will you all still go with me?
CLOUD
Please watch me so I don't do anything horrible.
TIFA
…But, CLOUD.
BARRET
…But, you know…
RED XIII
…All right, CLOUD.
YUFFIE
All right, we'll watch you.
VINCENT
…I see.
CID
Well, if somethin' happens, it happens.
CLOUD
I wonder how AERIS was going to save this planet from Meteor. We have no way of finding out now.
CLOUD
But…
CLOUD
We still have a chance. We need to get the Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses Meteor.

Which way'd that damn foo' Sephiroth go?
TIFA
Sephiroth… I wonder which way he went?
RED XIII
Sephiroth… which way did he go?
CID
…Which way did that creep Sephiroth go!?
YUFFIE
Ummm… Which way did that Sephiroth guy go?
CAIT SITH
I wonder which way Sephiroth went?
VINCENT
Which way did Sephiroth head?
