…To wake me from the nightmare
Who is it!?
…I don't know you. You must leave.
You were having a nightmare.
You were having a nightmare.
You were having a nightmare.
I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
Aren't you glad you woke up?
You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
How bad was your dream?
…You don't look good.
Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!
The air's pretty heavy here.
How can you sleep in a place like this?
Hmph…a nightmare? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
What are you saying?
What's he talking about?
What the hell are you saying?
I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.
This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
…You can say that again.
…That's for sure.
…It's startin' to look that way!
Hmm? Do you know something?
Don't say a thing
Talk about Sephiroth
Nothing I'd tell a stranger.
Nothing I feel like telling a stranger about.
Nothin' I'd tell a stranger.
Again… Do you know anything?
Nothing
Tell him about Sephiroth
I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare…
…Do you have something to tell me?
No, good night
Tell him about Sephiroth
…Hmm.
Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.
Just like you said, this mansion is the start of a nightmare…
It's like you said, this mansion's the beginning of a nightmare.
No, it's not a dream, it's for real.
No, not a dream…it's reality.
No, it's not a dream, it's the truth.
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth's gone nuts. He found a ton of secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth!?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You start first.
…That's how it was.
…That's how it was.
…That's how it was.
So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?
…He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.
He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.
Now it's your turn.
Now it's your turn.
Now it's your turn.
Sorry…I cannot speak.
Hey! You lyin' white-faced…
Hey, that's not right---
That's dirty!
Hmm…I'm disappointed.
What…you're serious?
Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway.
Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!
Hearing your stories, is yet another sin for me.
More nightmares shall come to me now, than I previously had.
Now…please leave.
…You're still here.
Good night
Who are you?
At least tell us your name.
At least tell us your name.
At least say your name.
I was with…Shinra Manufacturing in Administrative Research, also known as--the Turks.
VINCENT.
The Turks!?
The Turks!?
Turks!?
Formerly of the Turks.
I have no affiliation with Shinra now.
…And you?
CLOUD, formerly of SOLDIER.
Former SOLDIER, CLOUD.
TIFA, formerly of the AVALANCHE.
CID, formerly of the Space Program Department.
You were also with Shinra…? Then do you know Lucrecia?
Ex-AVALANCHE… Then you wouldn't know Lucrecia…
Who?
Who?
Who?
…Lucrecia.
I don't.
No.
No idea.
The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
…gave birth…?
Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
…gave birth…?
Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
…gave birth…?
Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.
He was born from a beautiful lady.
That lady was Lucrecia.
She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful…Lucrecia.
…A human experiment?
…A human experiment?
…A human experiment?
There was no way to cancel the experiment.
I couldn't stop her.
That was my sin.
I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.
So you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
So your punishment was to sleep? That's…strange.
So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
So you slept as punishment? Isn't that rather strange logic?
You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?
You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
OK. Boring story no.1.
Let me sleep…
Wait!
If I go with you, will I meet Hojo?
If I go with you, will I meet Hojo?
Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later…
Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might……
I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance…
Yeah, probably…
Yes, probably…
Yeah, probably…
Lucrecia…
All right. I've decided to go with you.
W, what?
What? You're coming with us?
What?
That sure was a quick change of heart.
What?
Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!
Huh? Oh great just what I needed…
Being a former Turk, I may be of help…
All right, then.
All right, I understand.
Alright then.
