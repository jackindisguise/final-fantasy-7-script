President Shinra
How are the preparations going?
Heidegger
Gya, haa, haa!!  Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to this.
Reeve
President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a group with only a few members…
President Shinra
What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?
Reeve
…No.
But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why…
Heidegger
Reeve, flush your personal problems with the rest of your crap!
Reeve
The Mayor's against this anyway…
Heidegger
Mayor?
He just sits in this building all day feeding his face! You still call that a Mayor?
Heidegger
Now if you'll excuse me sir!
President Shinra
You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go somewhere.
President Shinra
We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then we'll send in the rescue operation, care of Shinra, Inc…. Heh, heh, heh…this is perfect.
Heidegger
Gya, haaa, haa!
Sewer
TIFA
Man! This is terrible.
CLOUD
You alright?
AERIS
Yeah.
AERIS
Well, the worst is over…
AERIS
Maybe not…
Let's try and jump down
Let's not…
TIFA
It's too late… Marlene…BARRET …the people of the Slums.
AERIS
Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?
TIFA
…Yeah…you're right! We still have time.
Train Graveyard
CLOUD
AERIS, I got you mixed up in this…
AERIS
Don't tell me to go home.
TIFA
If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here.
[Save Point]
Received "Hi-Potion"!
Received "Ether"!
Received "Potion"!
Received "Echo Screen"!
TIFA
We made it! The pillar's standing!
CLOUD
Wait! You hear something above us?
AERIS
…gun fire?
CLOUD
BARRET?
CLOUD
I'm going up!
CLOUD
AERIS! You look after Wedge.
TIFA
AERIS, do me a favor.
I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.
There's a little girl named Marlene there.
AERIS
Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
TIFA
It's dangerous here! Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!
Everyone get out of Sector 7!
CLOUD
Wedge!! You all right!?
Wedge
…CLOUD. You remembered…my name.
Wedge
BARRET's up top. …Help him…
Wedge
An' CLOUD… Sorry, I wasn't any help.
Wedge
CLOUD… It hurts…
TIFA
CLOUD!! You've gotta go now, or BARRET's…
Hey now!! Oops!!
What on earth are you doing? Just butt out…geez!
Huh? You came to see it, too?
There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust…
Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.
Hey!! Check it out! It's huge, ain't it?
Hey… This is a strange and wonderful place.
This is my place, but you can come here when you want. See ya, bro!
Ah…eh…uhm. Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance.
Did I do good this time?
You gotta be tougher!
But, uh, I…
W, wow! You're great!!
Damn right!! Don't waste time talkin's what I always say!
What the hell do you want? You know who I am?
You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.
If you understand, then scram!
Listen… My partner's pretty mean, I wouldn't get him mad, if I were you.
You know, I got some tickets to 'Loveless', do you want to go?
What're you, retarded? Midgar's under martial law now!
Sir, are you really concerned for me?
Hell no!! But in case you forgot, we're in the middle of a slum. They could be anywhere around, so stay on your guard.
Right. You mean the AVALANCHE?
Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.
Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it?
I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam?
Damn right!! blahblahblah…
Hey shut up for a minute and let me get back to work!
…sigh.
What are you more scared of AVALANCHE or me?
Oh, you, of course.
HALT!! No one is allowed to pass!!
[Save Point]
AERIS
Don't worry. You let me handle this.
Uh oh… There goes the pillar.
I'm scared, but it's for your own good.
If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll see happen too often.
Uhh…Help! My strange and wonderful little place.
L, look… This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute.
Umm… I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here with you.
B, but… What happens if AVALANCHE shows up?
Umm…you're shaking. You're so gentle…I think I'm in love.
Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!
I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great… I'm quitting tomorrow!
Jessie
…CLOUD… I'm glad……I could talk with you…one last time.
Don't say 'last'……
Is that so…
Jessie
That's…all right…
Because…of our actions…many……people died…… this probably……is our punishment…
Jessie
…Is…that so……?
Ha……cool……as usual… ex-…SOLDIER. …always…I liked that…in you…
Biggs
CLOUD… so you don't care…what happens… to the…Planet?
Nope, not interested
You're wounded……
Biggs
Hmph…you haven't changed. Oh, forget it.
Biggs
Thanks, CLOUD. …don't worry 'bout me…… BARRET's…fighting up there. Go help him…
BARRET
TIFA! CLOUD! You came!
Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter.
TIFA
Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force!

Reno
You're too late. Once I push this button…
BARRET
Stop!
Reno
That's all, folks! Mission accomplished.
BARRET
DAMN! It's a time bomb!
TIFA
We have to disarm it! CLOUD! BARRET! Please!
Reno
I can't have you do that. No one get in the way of Reno and the Turks…
TIFA
CLOUD! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!
CLOUD
…It's not a normal time bomb.
Tseng
That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.
It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
TIFA
Please, stop it!
Tseng
Ha ha ha……
Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.
BARRET
Shut yer hole!
Tseng
I wouldn't try that…… You just might make me injure our special guest.
CLOUD
AERIS!!
TIFA
AERIS!!
Tseng
Oh, you know each other?
Tseng
How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me.
CLOUD
What are you gonna do with AERIS!?
Tseng
I haven't decided.
Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.
Tseng
It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President.
AERIS
TIFA, don't worry! She's all right!
TIFA
AERIS!
AERIS
Hurry and get out!
Tseng
Ha, ha, ha… Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?
TIFA
We're not going to make it!
BARRET
Yo, we can use this wire to get out!
BARRET
Jus' hang on to me!
TIFA
Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!
BARRET
Marlene! MARLENE!!
BARRET
MAR---LE---NE!!
BARRET
Biggs!
BARRET
Wedge!!
BARRET
Jessie!!
BARRET
Goddamn it!!!
BARRET
Dammit!
BARRET
DAMMIT ALL!!!!
BARRET
What the hell's it all for!?
BARRET
ARGGHHHH!!!
CLOUD
Hey, BARRET!
TIFA
BARRET!
CLOUD
Hey!
TIFA
BARRET, stop… Please stop, BARRET.
BARRET
URGHHHH!!!
BARRET
God damn…
BARRET
Marlene…
TIFA
… BARRET?
TIFA
Marlene is… I think Marlene is safe.
BARRET
…huh?
TIFA
Right before they took AERIS, she said, 'Don't worry, she's all right.' She was probably talking about Marlene.
BARRET
Rrr, really!?
TIFA
But…
BARRET
Biggs… Wedge… Jessie…
CLOUD
All three of them were in the pillar.
BARRET
Think I don't know that?
BARRET
But…we, all of us fought together.
BARRET
I don't wanna think of them as dead!
TIFA
…And the other people in Sector 7.
BARRET
This is all screwed up!
They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people…
TIFA
…Are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
BARRET
No, TIFA! That ain't it! Hell no!!
It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra!
BARRET
They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to…
build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!
BARRET
Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!
TIFA
…I don't know.
BARRET
What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
TIFA
It's not that. I'm not sure about…me. My feelings.
BARRET
An' what about you?
CLOUD
…
BARRET
Yo!
BARRET
Where's he think he's goin'?
TIFA
Oh! AERIS!
BARRET
Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?
TIFA
…I don't really know… but she's the one I left Marlene with.
BARRET
Damn! Marlene!!
TIFA
AERIS said that Marlene was safe.
BARRET
TIFA. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Sector 6 park
You may not take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "Sense" Materia!
CLOUD!
BARRET
Take me to Marlene!
TIFA
You're going to help AERIS?
CLOUD
Yeah… But before that, there's something I want to know.
TIFA
What's that?
CLOUD
…It's about the Ancients.
Now listen good! The Ancients are the rightful rulers of this Planet!
CLOUD
"Sephiroth…?"
TIFA
Are you all right?
BARRET
Pull it together, man!
Sector 6
In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!
