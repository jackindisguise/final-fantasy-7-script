Costa del Sol Harbor
BARRET
Damn! Sure is hot here!
But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.
Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
AERIS
Oh, too bad. I liked BARRET's sailor suit. He looked so cute.
BARRET
…What'ya mean 'cute'?
TIFA
Right…well, uh…
BARRET, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?
Right, CLOUD?
I guess
Keep your mind on Sephiroth
CLOUD
Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.
I'm going on ahead.
BARRET
Hmmph, CLOUD. You're the one who's always hangin' around wastin' time.
I'm going to skip this resort!
CLOUD
Ahhh… You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
BARRET
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up!
RED XIII
…puff…puff…
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
YUFFIE
Yeah, mine, too!!
CLOUD
All right. We'll take a break and then head off.
Don't wander too far off.
BARRET
I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
RED XIII
It looks like my mane got messed up.
I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
TIFA
I think I'll go swimming.
AERIS
Sounds good to me!
AERIS
Hmm? CLOUD, are you thinking of anything in particular?
Your cool exterior's cracking…
AERIS
Well then, let's go!
AERIS
Maybe I should get a tan for a change.
Which do you like, CLOUD?
I like fair complexions
Maybe a healthy tan is nice
AERIS
Got it. I'll remember that.
YUFFIE
Don't bother looking for me!
What a long boat ride that was!!
Rufus
Hmmm… Good work everyone…
Heidegger
Gya, Haa, haa…ha!! Hurry up with that!
Yes, sir!!
Rufus
I heard Sephiroth was on board.
Heidegger
Yes.
Rufus
And it seems CLOUD and the others were on board, too.
Heidegger
Yes.
Rufus
They all slipped through… You messed up big this time, Heidegger.
Heidegger
I'm ashamed of myself.
Rufus
Is that all you can do? Give one word answers and apologize for everything?
Rufus
Do something. I'll be expecting results.
Ready for departure, sir!!
Rufus
Very well then. That was fast.
You're outstanding. I'll remember you.
YES, SIR!! Thank you, sir.
Rufus
Remember Heidegger, You're allowed only one mistake.
I'm the boss!
But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand.
On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever… Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna.
It's the ultimate high!
He's quite handsome, isn't he?
Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond… He even looks good in a double-breasted suit.
Heh, heh… I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.
Heh, heh! Got nothing to do with us, does it?
Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!
Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head!
Da plane, da plane!! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime.
So you just watch from a distance… and wish.
Costa del Sol…a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round!
Hmm…Things aren't going well… You can go sightseeing in the city.
You're stowaways, right?
It's okay. I'm used to them.
The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.
Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President.
It seems like he's here on business this time.
I'm so jealous of him I could spit. We're both about the same age but he's President.
Oh crap… The manager of Shinra won't come down.
Even though the President's here on business. All he does is play, forgetting everything to do with work.
Rufus complimented me on my job!
Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.
Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!
Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship.
That's tough for both of us.
Ride the Shinra ship?
Yeah, I could go for that
Don't think I could steer it
Oh…is that so?
Yep! Actually, we do have an old junker we're gonna get rid of, And I was thinking about going into the tourist business.
But it's probably tougher than it looks I better think this through a little more…
Yeah. It's too much for an amateur!
Shinra manager
Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!
I mean it, I'm really gonna quit!!
Shinra manager
Heidegger's such an idiot!!
And Rufus, acting all big!!
Shinra manager
God, that sure felt good…
The transport ship won't be sailing for quite awhile. Heidegger's orders.
Thinking of being stowaways?
It's 100 gil to Junon. Give it to me, and I'll put in a good word with the captain.
What'll we do?
Pay up
Don't do it
Thank you. Come back any time you want to stowaway on our ship.
Hey! No money? And you're trying to stowaway? Don't make me laugh!
Okay. Come on. This way.
It's not the most pleasant ride but make the best of it.
Ever since Rufus complimented him, he strutted around for awhile, and haven't heard a peep from him since…
Today's a great day for a nap in the sun. It always puts me in a good mood!
Hey, who're you? You look like you've been around the world twice.
I don't know what your story is, but hang in there.
Everyone's in a rush to get one last vacation in before the Meteor strikes. That's why it's so busy here.
There's no ship to Junon. Recently, there's been a hoard on materials. Everything's topsy-turvy.
Not gonna be able to nap like this for much longer.
When you put it that way, I feel kind of sad.
Well, I'm not worried. When it all comes down, I'm heading for the skies.
The only problem is… will there be anywhere left to land?

BARRET
Damn! Sure is hot here!
But I sure am glad I can get rid of that damn sailor suit.
Yo listen up!! Make sure to mingle like regular folks here!

Oh‚too bad. I liked BARRET's sailor suit. He looked so cute.
BARRET
What'ya mean 'cute'?
TIFA
Right…well, uh…
BARRET, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?
Right, CLOUD?
Yeah‚maybe…
Concentrate on Sephiroth
CLOUD
Remember‚this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.
I'm going on ahead.
BARRET
Hmmph‚CLOUD. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time.
I'm checkin' this place out!
CLOUD
Ahhh… You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
BARRET
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be more comfortable, so shu'up!
RED XIII
…puff…puff…
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.

Rufus
Very well then. That was fast.
YES‚SIR!! Thank you‚sir.
Rufus
Remember Heidegger, Only one more mistake.
I'm the boss!
You'll never know what it's like to toil away on the ship.
Sailing over the blue sea, gazing up at a sky that seems to drift on forever. Feels like you're taking a nap on birds wings.
It's the ultimate high!
Handsome…isn't he?
Don't worry‚I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming‚rich‚blond… He even looks good in a suit.
Heh‚heh… I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.

House for Sale
CLOUD's Villa
What a fluffy bed! It feels so great
Mmm… five more minutes…
Huh!?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. This is so embarrassing.
Take your time and look around.
So are you seriously considering buying?
The heck do ya mean?
I'm out of here
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue.
CLOUD
What are you selling?
That's pretty low. Are you pulling my leg?
I'm talking about this house. This villa used to belong to President Shinra. It only recently came back on the market.
How do you like it?
It has a large lot, comes fully furnished with this goose-down bed, and there's even a basement to boot.
The villagers call it the Shinra Villa.
Of course, we're not giving it away…
How much is it?
Not interested
Wha? How do you plan to buy it without a dime on you?
Well, the price, for your information, is a steal at 300,000 gil.
Out of your range? Out! Go on, out!
All items in the basement are included in the sale.
Well, please come by again if you should strike it rich.
I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that to happen unless you win big at Gold Saucer.
Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa?
The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply… indescribable.
Well, let's wait for the captain.
Hmm Is this some kind of joke?
'Praise the Lord,' it's a miracle!! Who'd ever think someone with some real money would ever come here?
I probably shouldn't even ask, but are you really going to buy it?
Yep, 300,000 gil
I changed my mind
Hmm, good-bye!! Good-bye fluffy bed!!
Oh well, I'm kind of glad!
Bought "Villa CLOUD"!
CLOUD
This is MY villa. Rest up in your new villa?
With pleasure
Gotta move on
Cellar
…SNORE…SNORE…
Geez my lower back's killing me!
Y, yes…sir!!
How do you do? I'm the manager.
Nice to meet you.
Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night.
Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself.
Received "Motor Drive"!
Received "Fire Ring"!
Received "Power Source"!
Costa del Sol
Say, aren't you bored?
Not that much
Yeah, we fight a lot
Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
Oh, really? I'm a little bored.
Come on, back to work now!
Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.
What do you want to know?
Where's the inn?
Where're the stores?
Show me around town
Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.
If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.
Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook.
It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West, and is a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.
Come on! I don't care about that!
If you want a good time, go to the beach! There are lots of beautiful women.
You wouldn't happen to be…rich?
Oh yeah…
Well, not so
You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking.
But I'll tell you just in case.
After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!
I thought so.
Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.
Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.
But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.
But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.
Yo! Wassup! We jus' hangin' out!!
Oh, the sun's so bright! Looks like another wonderful day!
1, 2, 3, here we go!
I heard. That big dog talks like a human.
That's cool …but weird.
It's the ocean. A creepy man was signaling for us to come.
I was scared to come here!
RED XIII
Hm, that's interesting.
It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.
You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will.
RED XIII
Grrr…
Shall we play our hand around here?
Not yet. Remember, no compromises.
You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.
But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.
Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach.
I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.
Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.
How about some 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made especially in Costa del Sol!
Butch
Yeah, I'd like to find a gorgeous chick and have a great time.
Butch
Well, we're lucky to have that cutie working for us part-time.
Butch
You got me there… We just hired her part-time.
She ran off with our money and Materia.
I guess any situation that seems too good to be true, usually is.
Well, please feel free to browse around. Just don't mind looking at leftovers.
YUFFIE
Ah, CLOUD! Let me make a buck why don't you?
I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some?
YUFFIE
Orders are taken at the counter.
It hurts when you kick me with your bare feet!
Why's that!?
Not yet!!
Eaghhh!
It's your fault!
What's wrong with you!?
You wanna go!?
Whew!!!
Grrrrr…
A man…
A good-looking man…
Where?
Ho! Ho! Ho…
Yipes!!
Grrrr…
…pant…wheeze…
I don't feel like sightseeing around town. What I really want to do is have fun…  …too bad Gold Saucer is temporarily closed.
Butch
Good or bad everything's gotta go! It's the end of the world sale!!
Wanna buy a souvenir to remember participating in the Meteor tour?
Oh wow!! Man, that's huge!!
The stars!! They're in flames!!
They're burning. Someday they'll burn out.
The stars are just like our youth.
Ho! Ho! Ho! It's the end of the world.
Bar
You want drink? Iz OK. You take time.
Mukki
I really like this town.
You could walk around here naked, and no one'd look twice.
…huff…puff… I can't stand hot places…
…HIC… Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.
Hey! I thought you'd drop by.
(That's 1, 2…4 fishes all together…not bad.)
Come on…please. If you don't buy from me… I won't be able to pay the rent.
Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year.
I'm sick of surfing.
We're all headin' over to Gold Saucer now.
We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races.
Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.
Welcome to Bar del Sol! Here's to tropical nights!
We look like great surfers…
But the only clothes we have are these swim trunks.
I traveled around a long time… And this town has the most beautiful ocean I've ever seen.
Sometimes you can't recognize things when they're right in front of you.
I guess I took it for granted because it's so close, and I was so used to seeing it all the time.
That's why I came back here.
I don't care whether Meteor comes or not, I'm not giving up yet!
I still haven't surfed the best waves of Costa del Sol!
I hope the Meteor doesn't strike before I do.
It's weird seeing Meteor's reflection on the sea in the evening! It gives you the creeps.
But the sun has risen! ???
Well, for that reason, I'm at the store today too.
I wan' learn how speak beddah.
But don' wan' have stars fall down. You think…same?
Mukki
I just want to sit here with my drink.
My boss is a total arrogant ass!
I'm gonna tell him off! I'm gonna scream my head off!
Isn't that what life's all about? What do you think?
…huff…wheeze… Heat and cold are just memories of the Planet…
Come on…please. If you don't buy from me… I can't pay the rent. No one else will either.
While you're here, forget all those awful things going on outside, and just enjoy yourself.
Costa del Sol Inn
Uggh!  I feel God awful! Oh!! You!
Weren't you with that big sailor?
Dunno what you're talking about
Wasn't me
CLOUD
What's the matter?
CLOUD
I don't know.
Wrong guy? This is bad for us. That guy's taken over the john.
And he hasn't even paid his hotel bill yet.
Listen to this…
A big sailor just busted in here all of a sudden, and took over the restroom.
He's been in there moaning ever since.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Ah…if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?
Come now, we know he's a friend of yours…(fibber)
What now? Call it a night?
200 gil a night.
Stay
I changed my mind
What now? Call it a night?
200 gil a night.
Stay
I've changed my mind
Cradled by the sound of the ocean… sweet dreams…
Are you sure? Please come again.
Shucks!!  Too bad!
Hey! Hey you! Does your friend have a cute lady?
She came in here looking for him a while ago. You better find her.
What are you going to do? Just forget about her and go to bed?
200 gil a night.
Stay
Changed my mind
You look like you can handle it. Well then…
That's right. Don't worry. Please come by again.
Welcome!! What's it going to be?
200 gil a night.
Stay
Changed my mind
You sure? I'll just be playing around here so drop by whenever you feel like it.
You must be tired.
The weather for Costa del Sol tomorrow is going to be…sunny, again.
Good morning. Be careful traveling.
Your party has departed.
Oops…
That's bad luck…
I mean, they have already left.
Wait a minute! There's not enough money here.
Good morning!!
BARRET
Uh uh!
BARRET
Hmmm!?
BARRET
Marlene! You OK?
BARRET
I'll wear this when I go to see you.
BARRET
Yo, CLOUD! Still too early, ain't it?
BARRET
Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, alright!?
AERIS
Whew… I don't know why I'm so tired.
There's so many things I don't understand…
I feel a little uneasy.
AERIS
CLOUD…?
What do you think of me?
I dunno
Nothing much
CLOUD
I don't understand anything.
CLOUD
Sorry, but I never think about those things.
AERIS
How could you say such a thing! Sometimes you make me so mad!
Oh, I never should have brought it up!!
AERIS
…You're right.
Even I don't understand myself.
I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient?
What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it?
I don't understand it…
Ahh…I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this? Everything's so complicated.
AERIS
I'm going to sleep.
AERIS
I don't want to talk about it!
Be careful!
I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to spend the rest of my life sleeping.
Good night.
Will you be staying together?
Yes
No, thanks
Stop looking like a hunted animal! Whatever happens…happens.
Just go with it.
Johnny's New Home
Johnny
What's with YOU?
Johnny
Hey, is it really you?
We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were such a playboy.
And a $#&^ murderer!!
Why can't I remember your name?
Who are YOU?
I'm CLOUD, and don't forget it
Johnny
That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?
That's okay. We'll just pretend like we don't know each other.
I started a new life in this town.
A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my complaining! I sure envy you all living out under the stars.
Johnny
You think you're good enough to brag about how big you are?
I don't wanna hear it! Heh, no more complaining from me!
From now on, I'm turning over a new leaf!
Johnny
Go on and beat it!
I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life.
I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks and has been depressed lately.
TIFA
Oh, right! I remember that, too.
Johnny
Yeah, yeah! And you remember the time when….
TIFA
Hee, hee, hee!
Johnny
Ha, ha, ha!
TIFA
Ha, ha…oh stop it! That's right. Oh really…
Johnny
Yeah. Oh yeah, and then that time…
TIFA
Yeah, yeah!
TIFA
CLOUD, would you mind leaving us alone for the day?
We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change.
Johnny
Yeah, don't get mad or anything.
TIFA
I'll try not to be back too late.
So please don't worry about us!
Worry?
Yeah…
CLOUD
I'm not worried.
CLOUD
Just remember we're leaving early tomorrow.
TIFA
You're right…
TIFA
OK, I know.
Johnny
…mumble…mumble… (TIFA, promise me you're gonna be happy.)
Johnny
Heh, heh, heh! She and I are getting along pretty good.
But I'm such a pitiful waste…
Johnny
…sigh…I'm not good enough for her. What should I do?
Johnny
I proposed to her in the middle of all that Meteor stuff!
I don't care even if the world were to end right now!
I can't think of anything else!
Johnny
No, no, NO!! Meteor's getting closer every minute!!
I wanna live my life right now!! I want to build a home and grow old together with her!
If you can't do it, then I will! And that's that!
I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there too!
If you can't do it, then I will! And that's that!
I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there too!
Costa del Sol
AERIS
Oh! CLOUD!!
TIFA
Look, look at that!
CLOUD
Hm?
Who, Hojo?
That girl in the bikini?
CLOUD
Is that man over there, Hojo?
TIFA
Go over and talk to him.
CLOUD
Not a bad view…
TIFA
What're you looking at?
That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him!
God!! What do you want?
I want to talk with him
Is that Hojo?
(Hey, who do you think you are?)
Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you.
(What's his problem?)
Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!
Professor… someone's here to see you, sir.
AERIS
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hojo
I'm busy right now.
…But, Too bad.
Hojo
No, I remember you all now…
Hojo
Heh heh heh… All right. You sure are loud.
Long time no see, CLOUD.
Hojo
Yes, yes. I remember now.
It's been a long time, CLOUD.
CLOUD
Hojo…
Hojo
Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.
CLOUD
What are you doing?
Hojo
It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan.
CLOUD
Answer me!
Hojo
Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal.
CLOUD
You mean Sephiroth?
Hojo
Did you see him?
Hojo
I see…Ha! Ha!
CLOUD
What is it?
Hojo
Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis…
Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?
Or that you had to visit some place?
CLOUD
I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at!
To beat him and put an end to all this!
Hojo
I see… This could be interesting.
Were you in SOLDIER? Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?
Hojo
Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?
AERIS
CLOUD, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything!
TIFA
Stop, CLOUD! I know how you feel, but you mustn't.
BARRET
Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him.
RED XIII
…huff…puff… Stop, CLOUD!
YUFFIE
Knock it off, CLOUD! Look I don't know, but he knows a lot of stuff, right?
Hojo
Ha! Ha! Ha!…
Hojo
Say, aren't you the 'Ancient'? 
AERIS
I'm AERIS. The least you can do is remember my name.
AERIS
I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo…
AERIS
I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me.
Hojo
Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?
AERIS
You didn't know!? She died.
Hojo
…I see.
AERIS
Professor Hojo?
Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?
Hojo
…
Hojo
…mumble…mumble…head west…
AERIS
He's mumbling slowly… That must mean he's hiding something!
TIFA
Hey! Answer us!!
RED XIII
Grrr, Grrr… …huff…puff…
CLOUD
It's no use. It's no go.
Professor Hojo is so sweet. He's going to experiment on me.
He never takes off his lab coat even in this heat. I guess that's the mark of an intellectual.
I'll interpret Professor Hojo's whispers.
Head west, past Mt. Corel and keep going…
Did you get that? I didn't understand it well, myself.
I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!
Yes, Professor Hojo. Where?
It looks like the Professor discovered or found a solution to something.
You know, I wonder… if they headed west for Mt. Corel?
I'm getting a little sad.
Professor Hojo looks happy like a child when he discovers something. He gets this big smile and then laughs…
I guess we should chase after him. A vacation for two from Mt. Corel to Gold Saucer.
That's right!! It totally skipped my mind!
There was something I was supposed to tell you.
That's right! It's about that!
It was yesterday. A man wearing a black cape came up from the ocean.
I think he had tickets for the Gold Saucer… no, that wasn't it… I wonder if it was all just an illusion?
Hey! President Rufus came here yesterday.
He used to be the President's little boy. We nicknamed him the little Prez!
He didn't look much different than the surfers on the beach.
heh heh… All the good ones are gone.
What about that one? Shall we make do with her?
But she's got a guy with her.
No problem, I can handle him.
Right? You thought so, too?
Geez! What about those two?
Heh heh…I want the one on the left.
Well then, I guess that leaves me with the one on the right.
Hey… heh heh…don't forget to talk to me, too.
Yipes!! Help!!
…breath…breath! Kind of takes your breath away, don't it!?
If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some "Soft".
At least that's what they always say, don't they?
Be prepared, and you'll never fear.
Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! Not bad, huh?
Hmm. Man, I'm draggin' today. It's all Shinra's fault.
I really hate Shinra, Inc.! They're all crooked, those Shinra.
Hmm… What a bitter guy Chill out a bit.
Eeeew!! Leave me alone!
Ublk! …glug…glug… You're gonna make me drown!
Always the same story… Women never pay any attention to me…
If this is your idea of flirting…forget it. I do fine as it is.
The sea, the wind and the sun. Don't you just love the outdoors? It always puts me back on track.
Hey, good timing. Would you mind putting lotion on me?
With pleasure
Sorry
Uhhhnn…
Than--kyu!
Hey, loosen up a bit.
Eaaggh!! Leave me alone!
I'm trying to learn how to swim before the end of the world.
Sitting around waiting for Meteor to come…… Why's it gotta fall on us?
It's getting closer and closer. Someone will do something, don't you think?
The sea breeze, sun and Meteor. Isn't nature strange?
I don't care even if it is the end of the world, I just want to sit here and drink cocktails!
Ooooh…I think I drank too much.
