CLOUD…wasn't it?
Well now, make yourselves at home.
It's about AERIS, isn't it?
…Sorry. The Shinra have her.
I know. They took her from here.
They were here?
That's what AERIS wanted…
Why is Shinra after AERIS?
AERIS is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
Not her real mother. …it must have been 15 years ago…
…during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.
One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave.
Her last words were, Please take AERIS somewhere safe.
My husband never came back. I had no child. I was lonely. So I decided to take her home with me.
AERIS and I became close very quickly. That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything.
She told me how she escaped from some kind of research laboratory, and that her mother had already returned to the Planet, so she wasn't lonely…many other things.
Returned to the Planet?
I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky, but she said it was this Planet…
She was a mysterious child in many ways.
Mom.
Please don't cry.
AERIS just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened…
Someone dear to you has just died.
His spirit was coming to see you, but he's already returned to the Planet.
At that time I didn't believe her.
But…
Several days later… we received a notice saying my husband died…
…and that was it.
A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day…
We want you to return AERIS to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
No! Never!
AERIS, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.
Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
At that moment, I found out she was an 'Ancient'.
The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.
AERIS will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.
That is why Shinra would like AERIS's cooperation.
He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
But AERIS, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?
No, I don't!
But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers.
She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed.
It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years…
The Shinra need her, so I guess they wouldn't harm her.
But why now?
She brought a little girl here with her.
Tseng found them on their way here. She probably wasn't fast enough to get away.
She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.
…Marlene.
Marlene!! AERIS was caught because of Marlene!?
I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm really sorry…
You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
…Please don't start with that. I'm always thinkin' about what might happen to Marlene, if I…
But you gotta understand somethin'… …I don't got any answers. I wanna be with Marlene… But I gotta fight.
'Cause if I don't…the Planet's gonna die.
So I'm gonna keep fightin'!
But inside I'm always thinkin' of her. I just wanna be with her…always.
See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
…I think I know what you mean. She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her?
It's my fault… I was the one who got AERIS involved in this.
Don't say that. AERIS doesn't think so.
I feel so depressed.
…sigh…
I'm so glad… I'm so glad you're all right…
Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!
You gonna go help AERIS, right? She's done so much for me…
If the Shinra're involved, I ain't stayin' here! I'm comin', too!
Guess what? Guess what? AERIS asked me lots of questions.
Like what kind of person CLOUD is. I bet she likes you, CLOUD!
I don't know
Let's hope so
Dummy!
I won't tell TIFA.
Looks like I can rest here.
Sleep
Don't want to sleep
AERIS's House
Daddy, TIFA, CLOUD! Please bring AERIS back!
You're going after AERIS, right?
I'm coming with you.
We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. …You gotta be prepared for the worst.
I know.
Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.
If I stayed here…I'd go crazy.
Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
Yes, I don't mind.
This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
…You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
Received "Cover" Materia!
How do we get to the Shinra Building?
There ain't no train that goes up there anymore…
…
Well, let's go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.
Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary…Brrr.
Oh man! This is horrible…
Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
Can we climb it?
Yeah. It leads to the upper world.
Alright! We'll climb the wire!
There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
Just a normal wire.
Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
You're right. This is the only way to save AERIS…
OK, that was a bad analogy, but, BARRET, I understand how you feel.
Plate Section
…Maybe if I put a battery in…
The propeller might work.
It might work if I put a battery in it.
I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.
Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar.
Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use [OK] to jump)
Jumped too soon…
Jumped too late…
Need a battery here, too.
Damn, out of batteries…
Shinra Bldg.
Shinra Bldg. Stairs
Yo… You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
Well we've got to get to AERIS to help her somehow.
Of all the out of the way…
I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!
Y, yo TIFA! Don't go alone!
Wait a minute, CLOUD!
Don't know… why…the hell… we gotta…climb…
…because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved AERIS.
If that's possible…
…heh heh heh.
Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
So even you will fight for someone else. Guess I figured you wrong.
Who cares what you figured!
I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong…
heh heh heh……
What's that supposed to mean, TIFA?
…how much farther do these stairs go on?
Why don't you ask them?
It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', is it?
Of course not!!
Right…couldn't be that…
Are we there yet?
Not yet.
…there yet?
I said not yet!
Yo…
Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there, OK!?
Yo… What floor is this?
…I stopped counting.
Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?
That Shinra… They're just no damn good.
…huff… Man, I'm beat…
Marlene, daddy wanted to see your face one more time…
Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?
It's just a bit more!
…maybe.
Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!
It'll take just as long to go down as it did to come up.
C'mon, BARRET. Pull it together!
Yeah well, all I know is I'm only flesh 'n' blood… cept for this arm of mine.
Don't treat me like I'm some ex-SOLDIER or somethin'…
What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!
Yaah! BARRET! You go first!
What're ya ignorant?  …I didn't mean that
All right, all right!
CLOUD, you go on ahead too!!
Received "Elixir"!
Received "Behemoth Horn"!
…finally… …made it…
…never wanna see… no more stairs the rest of my life…
…huff…puff… I'm beat…
But here we are. We'd better get ready!
sector 0
Hey, you oughta know this building well.
What's wrong?
…Not really, now that I think about it, this's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters.
I heard about this place before.
Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees.
Must be where they took AERIS.
The security's pretty light now. Alright, let's go!!
Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?
Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and…
That's not going to work! We've got to find another way…
Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, AERIS'll…
I know that! But if we get caught here…
Hey, CLOUD. …What should we do?
Let's bust on in!
Let's sneak in quietly
That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!
See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
No, no! The Sister Ray's not this way!
Shinra Bldg. 1f. lobby

Welcome… to the fully automated store. Place your order…now.
Received "Pile Bunker"!
Received "Master Fist"!
You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait!
This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
…I don't know. Now that you mention it, this's my first time at headquarters. What about you?
…I been here before. Back when I still had both my hands.
I hope AERIS is all right.
AERIS… She's been through a lot, huh.
You too, TIFA
…What's wrong?
I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved AERIS.
I should have known that was impossible though…
Heh, heh, heh.
Wh, what the!?
Look!
DA-MN!
Just stop it, CLOUD! I don't care where!
What's going on!?
Oh man!!
No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on.
Oh man!!
You…again?  Uh, I'll pass.
Elevator
Shinra Bldg. 59f.
Hey CLOUD!
We come this far, and you're thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?
No time for that now! Stop messin' around, boy!
Yeah, that's right! Let's go on!
Destroy the intruders!
What's this?
Received Key Item "Keycard 60"!
Shinra Bldg. 60f.
What're you doing here? Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed here!!
Your kind don't belong here! Go on, get out!
Hey there! What do you think you're doing there?
Look at all them guards runnin' around.
CLOUD, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to move.
Stay in the shadows!
When those guards turn around, MOVE!
What the hell're ya doin'? Man, you gotta do it again!
OK! We gonna rock!
Remember, we're here to save AERIS.
Hell, I know that!
I shoulda known it'd turn out like this…
If I knew it'd be like this in the first place…
Shhh! Now let's move on.
Wait for the soldiers to turn, then push [OK] to signal the others!
