Old man…
Yo!! Junon airport?
Just in time!
Come on! Let's go to the airport!
Ugh. It's salty! Let's go to the airport!
God!! I'm drenched!
Hurry up! Let's get to the airport!
Phew… The air up here's great!
Hey! Let's go to the airport!
Let's go to the airport!
Looks like we made it. You'll probably head for the airport, right?
Hmm…Junon.
I'd love to get my hands on a submarine right now.
Yeah! I could go for that! Let's go to the submarine dock under Junon!
There should only be a few guards now.
It might be safe to go to the submarine dock under Junon.
I would like to ride it! Let's get one from the submarine dock beneath Junon!
You want it? Then you got it! They're down at the submarine dock underneath Junon! You gotta get what you want while you can!
…Yeah!!
The submarine dock underneath Junon!  I can steal a sub easy enough, but I can't pilot it!
Security's pretty light now! The submarine's at the submarine dock!
It should be alright.
Let's go…
I sure was scared when Weapon attacked. It gives me the creeps knowing there's still two of them left.
Oh yeah? Well, I'm ready to fight mankind's worst enemy like a real warrior. It's not everyday you get to fight in an inter-planetary war.
The President is gathering up all the Huge Materia on the planet. He wants to shoot it at Meteor in the rocket.
President Rufus is different from the older generation. He'll protect the planet with all of Shinra's state of the art technology.
Protect it? No, I don't think so. The President isn't the type to do anything so heroic. It's all just a game to him a question of winning or losing.
They've finally started collecting the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor.
After they get it, they'll take it to the airport and will transport it to Rocket Town by Gelnika. Don't let your guard down!
Whew…I hope everything goes all right until we get to Rocket Town. Then, our mission is nearly complete.
Not so fast. We still have one major task… we still have to transport the stuff…
The stuff…
Oh no! The Huge Materia…
Oh no! The Huge Materia…
Let's go after it!
Can't we go after it?
Can we get there before they do?
Grrrrgh! Just barely! We're goin' after it!
Let's go after it.
How 'bout us getting there beforehand and stealing it back?
Let's get there before they do and catch 'em!
But where to?
Where are they headed?
Where's their destination?
Where's that thing headed?
Where is their destination…?
Where is it flying to?
Hey, where? Where? Where are they headed?
Rocket Town, of course.
I may be mistaken, but… doesn't it feel like we're missing something?
All I wanted was to become a pilot! I used to be speechless watching the Highwind in the sunset!
Finished loading the Huge Materia! All we have to do now is to ready the cargo ship, Gelnika', for departure and we're done!
It's kinda lonely at the airport without the Highwind, isn't it?
I miss that bikini girl on the side of the plane.
Right now the Shinra's using it to gather the Huge Materia from the Corel Reactor and from the Fort Condor Reactor.
The Gelnika's flying all over the place! The only one that's not busy, is probably me!
The Shinra's collecting Huge Materia at the Junon Underwater Reactor! When they're done, they'll bring it to this airport.
Get out of here before you get in the way!
What…me? I'm gonna be watching from here, so that I don't get in their way either!
I'm glad we got Gelnika to Rocket Town safely.
But they sure think big. Looks like they're going to use the Huge Materia to break up Meteor…
The Shinra Army's gathered at Midgar. Now it's just a matter of time Sephiroth's dead.
What…me? I don't mind. I'll just wait here. My life is important to me.
I finally got orders to join the Great Sephiroth Plan. I even get to go on the Gelnika too…
But, I'm just gonna ignore them. I wanna live to see the end of the world.
If I'm lucky… There'll be a good place for me in the New World.
Doesn't it bother you? Flying around knowing that you could die at any moment?
If that's the case, might as well live on the edge, I say. But before I can do that, I gotta get a license first.
Junon Path
Only authorized personnel are allowed past this point!
You know too, right? About Junon Navy's important classified information.
A new submarine has almost been completed using Shinra's top technology.
A new version of submarine. I'll be sailing on it. Man, I can't wait!
Man… Keeping watch is so boring at the Underwater Reactor.
OK! Back to work!! Back to work!!
Yawn…I'm sleepy!!
For Junon!!
Damn, Shinra dogs!!
We'll take that submarine!! Out of our way!!
This is the Junon Submarine Dock!
If you want to enter, please talk to my dog.
That's all the instructions you're going to get! Let's go!!
Junon Path
What is it? The elevator's out of order for an inspection.
You know, right under us is a Submarine Dock and the Underwater Mako Reactor.
Mako energy puts a lot of wear and tear on the machinery.
A lot of problems can pop up. So it's necessary for close inspections and maintenance.
Hey!! Civilian!! Stay out of our training!!
Go around them! And stay out of their way!!
All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!
Attention! Charge!!
He…hey!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!
Our forces are in the process of gathering the Huge Materia from the Corel and the Fort Condor Reactors!
Once these two missions are completed, the Underwater Reactor will be our next target!
Till then, we do nothing but train, train, train!
Elevator
…gulp… Going do---wn.
This floor is the Submarine Dock…
Those of you visiting the Underwater Reactor, please proceed through the connecting tunnel.
…gulp… Going u---p.
Returning to Junon.
…gulp…  We're here…
…gulp… (Great…there went two perfectly good men!)
How 'bout, whoever stays alive, gets to take her out?
All right, you're on!!
But… What if both of us…
Whoa!! Don't even talk about that!
Junon Path

Elevator
Locked
You, you're CLOUD!!
You are NOT getting this Huge Materia!!
So you WERE after the Huge Materia!
!? The Huge Materia!
Hey! A Crane Game!
Damn, just missed it!
They're gonna take it on that submarine!
That's what you think! ^%$@#&$#!
We were too late…
There's the submarine dock just ahead.
If we take a short cut, we might just make it!
Did we make it!?
Reno
What are you doing? Help load.
Reno
CLOUD!?
We're gonna help transport the Huge Materia…Reno!
Help?
I refuse…
You know I don't work cheap!
Looks like we barely made it.
I'm SURE! You want me to do manual labor?
Either give it to us or else.
…which is it gonna be?
Reno
Unfortunately, I don't have time to deal with you.
Reno
My priority is the Huge Materia!
Damn! The submarine!
Oh no! It left the dock…
Damn! So they was just buyin' time!?
Huge Materia…! Wait…!
We have to go after it!
But it's already in the water!
There is a way…
Hold on to your horses! Let's take it from 'em!!
Y, you!
You're not taking over this ship!
Hey, hey, hey! Where do you think you're goin'?
Wait a sec! What about the Huge Materia---?
Hey you! Where ya goin'?
CLOUD--! We have to go after Rude!
We ain't jus' gonna let them take the Huge Materia, are we?
Aren't we going after the Huge Materia?
Submarine Dock
Shinra dog!!
Ignore it
Dognap it!
Feelin' lonely!? Better get back to your master.
Shinra dog!! I'm gonna dognap you!!
Those attackers won't bother us now.
Inside Submarine
P…Please!! Spare me!!
Hmm…
Take them all hostage
Fight them
Be grateful. I'm taking you prisoner.
Don't think we're weak.
We can't go back after coming this far.
Thank you!
You're pretty nice!
Inside Submarine
You want the Sub? Just try an' take it!
Um…sir! Maybe we shouldn't piss them off…
Come on, CLOUD! Follow me!
Damn, man!! …What the?
Hey yo! Remember I was the leader first, man!
Yo! We come a long ways since we got on this train!
Lotsa things changed! This and that.
Inside Submarine
We're breakin' out of here!
But how? We're at the bottom of the sea!!
Whatcha gonna do!?
I can't swim…
Damn! What are we gonna do?
I wanna get outta here, now!
What we gonna do?
We're at the bottom of the sea.
We're gonna hop on a torpedo and blast outta here!
Don't worry! I won't miss!
We don't even have a target. We're just aiming at the sky.
Submarine Bridge
NO, NO!! This is terrible!
We don't have much time left! I don't want to die!
There's still so much more I've got to do!
I never even got to do my special victory dance in battle!
All right!! Then make this your first victory!!
Go on, show 'em!!
Yes, sir!!
Remember your last training. Begin!!
I'm back! An' now I got no regrets!!
ATT----ACK!!
Someone…please. I'm sorry I can't take it anymore.
The lack of space, the shaking, the roar of the engine…
Stop your blubberin'!! How we gonna move this without you?
DAMN! I've GOT to get back in the air!
I can't budge it.
I…I can't… I'm history.
What are we going to do? We stole a submarine but can't pilot it.
Better hurry. Reno's getting away.
I can't fit in this seat..." No good!
See!?
Just fiddle with the controls, and we'll get somewhere!
Hey CLOUD? Why don't you try piloting it?
They say you don't get motion sickness if you're driving.
You can do it, CLOUD!
Arrrrrrrgh!!
EY!! Looks likes we're almost on our way! Just keep on fiddlin' with it!!
It's all up to you!
Don't worry!
If it breaks down, I'll smack it one. That'll fix it!
It moved!
CLOUD!! Try it!
Hunka junk…just gotta do this!
SEE! Now you take over!
I'll be watchin' from here!
HEY---! It's movin'!
Oh man, this sucks!! CLOUD, do something!
I'll hold my breath, so HURRY!
It's movin'--- Keep it up, CLOUD!
Oh please drive safely, CLOUD!
I'm not very mechanical, but it seems like we're starting to move.
Hang in there.
Shinra's technology is really something.
Hey, you're right… I DO feel a little better driving.
No sweat. Just leave everything to me.
Well, now what?

Mission Orders
Presently on the ocean floor near Junon, a Red Leader Submarine carrying Huge Materia is being escorted by covert Shinra Submarine Units.
Furthermore, it has been confirmed that several mines have been dispersed onto the ocean floor.
The ocean floor can only be monitored with Shinra's Sonar Radar Screen.
Enemy subs can only be detected within the Sonar area.
Get in front of the detected enemy sub and "Lock On"!!
Push [SWITCH] to fire the torpedo! The mines are found on the radar screen at the top of the indicators.
The mines inflict great damage, so be careful!
Objective
Sink the Red Leader Submarine carrying the Huge Materia!
Time Limit: 10 minutes!
Advice
1. Get the enemy submarine in front of you!
2. When the lock-on marker flashes red, launch torpedos!
3. Concentrate attack on the Red Leader Submarine!
4. If you lose track of the enemy, push [PAGEDOWN] and use your radar!

Radar Screen
The mines are found at the top of the indicators on the screen.
The basic strategies are to 1) avoid the indicators, and 2) "Lock On" to enemies from behind.
The lower gauge shows the sub's remaining power.
The right gauge shows the sub's speed.
Other warnings are as follows…
WARNING…Enemy submarine detected nearby!
ALERT…Approaching torpedo detected!
MINE…Mine detected nearby!
CONFLICT…Collision with the ocean floor!
Loading torpedoes
Preparation time is needed before the next torpedo can be fired.
Take your time, and don't waste your shots!

Victorious in Mini-game
Defeat in Mini-game
Phew! We did it!!
The Huge Materia should be at the bottom of the sea by now. Let's continue the search…
…All Shinra Submarine Units, do you read…?
Hmm…? …Must be from Shinra.
…Report, No. 2…
No. 2…
…I saw that written at the dock! They must mean this sub.
Is it us?
We're Submarine No. 2
Make 'em shut up! Just answer somethin'!
Oh my god! They mean us.
We need to respond!
We've no choice but to respond.
All right, I'll do it.
This is Shinra No. 2… Everything's normal.
…Roger…
…Your next mission is…
…Return to Junon Dock…
…We will transport the Huge Materia from the airport…
…Those without other assignments will report for guard duty…
That is all. Over and out…
Junon Airport… We should make it if we hurry.
Forget about the Huge Materia for now.
We're climbing!
Aye, aye… CAPTAIN!
#%$@! What's all this 'Climbing!' crap? Gimme a break!
Take o-ff!
The airport? No sweat!
Climbing…arrrgh…my ears…! LET ME OUT--I HATE THIS!
We gotta hurry!
First the ocean, now the air… What a busy day.
Received "Shinra Sub"!
…We lost. I guess I'm just not cut out for all this.
We're gettin' outta here!
Hear that? Junon Airport!
We can still get the Huge Materia back! Let's hurry!
It seems like a key to somewhere…
Do you think it's…?
It seems really old.
…Analysis completed…
…Exact date of origin: undetermined…
…Estimated to be several thousand years old…
Key of the Ancients…
Several thousand years… ……Ancients?
Received Key Item "Key to Ancients"!
Anyhow…
So this is the Leader Sub…
Damn…makes me sick just thinking about it…
…Huge Materia recovered…
…No damage appears to have been sustained…
…phew… That's good to hear.
Received Key Item "Huge Materia"!
Hmmmm…
Fight them
Take them prisoner
Piloting a submarine is very difficult! I am completely clueless!
I thank you! I am happy to be a hostage!
Hey! Who am I to know?
Submarine Bridge
An unconditional surrender, huh?
We're your prisoners
Don't bet on it…
Received "Shinra Sub"!
We'll hide it somewhere secluded.
It looks like a key to something.
You think it could be…?
It seems really old.
…Analysis completed…
…Exact date of origin undetermined…

The Key of the Ancients…

This is the Shinra's Gelnika type airplane… I wonder why it went down here?
What is this place? Must be some kind of a Research Establishment because there's a Mako generator.
This is terrible… It's all messed up…
This must be the Cargo Room…
Turks!?
Rude
Again?
Reno
We just seem to keep running into each other lately!
Reno
There were weapons and Materia developed solely to destroy Sephiroth.
Rude
But, it was attacked by Weapon and sunk to the bottom of the sea.
Reno
I can't give you what's here. We'll take out Sephiroth.
I guess this is our last meeting.
Rude
I won't let you get in our way.
So Shinra's new, secret weapon was on this Airship…
???
Sephiroth…
VINCENT…
!!!
That voice? It can't be…
Lucrecia?
VINCENT?
Lucrecia!!
Lucrecia
Stay back!!
Lucrecia… You're alive…
Lucrecia… You're alive…
Lucrecia
I wanted to disappear… I couldn't be with anyone… I wanted to die…
But the Jenova inside me wouldn't let me die…
Lucrecia
Lately, I dream a lot of Sephiroth… My dear, dear child.
Ever since he was born I never got to hold him…
Not even once. You can't call me his mother… That…is my sin…
Lucrecia…
Lucrecia
Back!! Stay back!
Lucrecia
VINCENT… Won't you please tell me?
What?
Lucrecia
If Sephiroth is still alive?
I heard that he died five years ago. But I see him in my dreams so often…
And I know that physically, like myself, he can't die so easily.
Please, VINCENT tell me…
Lucrecia… Sephiroth is dead…
Received "Death Penalty"!
Received "Chaos"!
Lucrecia…
If she is happy then… I don't mind.
After that, a child was born to Lucrecia… 
That child's name was… Sephiroth…
I'm against it!! Why experiment on humans!?
She and I are both scientists!!
Urrrrrrrrgh!!
This body is… the punishment that's been given to me…
I was unable… to stop Professor Gast and Hojo…
And Lucrecia…I was unable to stop them…
All that I was able to do was watch… That is my punishment…
