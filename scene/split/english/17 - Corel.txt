Mt. Corel
Whew!!
Hey!
You're actually talking to me.
I just passed a guy in a black cape back there.
I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me!
CLOUD
What is it?
CLOUD
Sephiroth…
BARRET
…ahh.
TIFA
Let's hurry on.
AERIS
There was a black-caped guy here, too?
YUFFIE
Oh gawd, what a drag!!
RED XIII
Hmm… I'm moving on ahead…
It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.
If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back.
Whew! being on the road.

CLOUD
OW!! Sure is tight in here…
Come on, CLOUD, don't let it get to you. Let's see…this is it.
CLOUD
Maybe if I turn this…
…something should happen.
Do it
Leave it
CLOUD
OK, then…
PHS
Let's move on!
TIFA
OH!! CLOUD! That's it!
TIFA
We can't go on until the bridge is let down.
I think there's a switch in that shack over there…
But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat…
AERIS
CLOUD!!
AERIS
I was just wishing you were here!
Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck.
CLOUD should be able to do something.
But let's take a breather first.
AERIS
Come on, CLOUD. Let's rest a minute.
RED XIII
Wha? Oh, it's you.
RED XIII
There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge.
Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.
BARRET
…whew!
YUFFIE
I don't want to have to go all that way!
TIFA
I'm beat…
AERIS
I'm sure glad I'm with you, CLOUD!
RED XIII
What?
YUFFIE
I'm pooped!
TIFA
CLOUD!! Go CLOUD!! Go!!
AERIS
Oh, CLOUD!! Good Luck!!

Yeow! Lookit that!!
BARRET
Haaeyy!
RED XIII
huff…huff…
CLOUD
What should we do?
Take the treasure
Leave it where it is
CLOUD
Times are tough… I'm taking the treasure.
CLOUD
…It's got nothing to do with us. Just forget about it.
TIFA
Right! That was admirable of you.
TIFA
Oh! CLOUD! Your hair looks like a Chocobo!
AERIS
CLOUD…
YUFFIE
You kiddin'?
RED XIII
Glu…glug…

Come to Mommy!!

Mt. Corel
Hey! How'd you ever wind up here?
Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!
Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal mining town!
They say there were more jobs than you could shake a… Well, you get the picture!
Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer…everyone's out of work.
Got no job…I can't even show my face. Bout all that's left for me is just livin' in this hole all day.

BARRET
You heard 'em… It's my fault this town was…destroyed…
BARRET
Wait here…
BARRET
Can't keep regrettin' the past… It's the future we gotta think about now.
BARRET
…I'm sorry…
YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.
I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks!
I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to happen.
Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor!
Ya think they can really do it? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!
Look down… nuthin' but junk. Look up…Meteor.
Am I gonna be stuck between these two for the rest of my life?
“”
I wanna play at the Gold Saucer…
And it's only a Ropeway ride away… but I don't have enough money to play…
Those people over there, they with you?
Well, I feel sorry for 'em! Hangin' around a walkin' death sentence like BARRET.
They kick you out of another town or somethin'?
You destroy everything you touch.
Why doncha say something!?
Or did ya forget what you done here already?
Get out of the way!!
The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by collecting junk!
You, you're…
Hey!! He's back!
You got a lot of nerve comin' back here!
Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into a garbage heap!
^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort.
Don't waste your time talkin' to that Techno-freak!
Whenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in the face…
If you're gonna crash down, then hurry up!! Cause I'm gonna kick the $#@& outta ya!
A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'.
When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head!!
Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia.
I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor.
Staring up at Meteor won't put food in my stomach.
But if I look down, sometimes I find somethin' to eat.
I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that right?
I wouldn't know
That's right
Really…? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.
I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, 0' oughtta be perfect.
Hey, what's gonna happen to the world?
I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold Saucer is closing…
Hey, the Gold Saucer reopened!
We've got to play hard to get our minds off Meteor.

Listen to your story
Not interested
Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station!
The Ropeway'll take you to the Gold Saucer.
It don't mean much to us poor folks though…
Sometimes, I see something glowin' inside the well. If I ever get it, I'm going to sell it and go to the Gold Saucer.
I'm gonna keep diggin' in this well till I come out on the other side of the world…
Then, I'm going to make lotsa friends.
I got this out of that well. This rock must REALLY be something!!
Whoops… You can't hold all those.
Here, I'll keep it in my pocket, and you can come by later and get it, OK?
TIFA
I wonder what Shinra wants to do with all that Huge Materia?
RED XIII
What are we going to do now?
CID
Sorry… I never shoulda gave that Huge Materia to the Shinra so easily…
YUFFIE
No use baggin' on yourself! It's not like you, OLD guy!
CAIT SITH
It's not all over yet. Cheer up!
VINCENT
…Isn't is too early to give up?
Received "Ultima" Materia!
CID
There's only one more Huge Materia the Shinra needs… That's the one at the Underwater Reactor.
CID
With us always in their face, even the Shinra's gotta be getting tired of it all.
CID
We have to hurry that much… …Right now I'm more worried about him than anything else!
CID
Yeah, and I'm worried about TIFA, too.
CID
Let's go see what's going on at Mideel…
BARRET
We'll get there first!
BARRET
CLOUD…
RED XIII
We HAVE to stop them!!
RED XIII
Must be about CLOUD…
YUFFIE
We've got to hurry and stop 'em!!
YUFFIE
You must be talking 'bout CLOUD…

We headin' out to the Underwater Reactor?

Are we going to the Underwater Reactor?

Inside Tent
Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer.
He still can't kick his old habits from then.
Seeing that train got Grandpa more excited than I've seen him for some time.
As long as we stay here, Grandpa won't be able to forget about trains.
Maybe we should start fresh, and move to Southern Isle of Mideel?
With Meteor coming, I guess it doesn't matter…
The next train's coming in soon.
What the? Watch out for the train!
Received "Ether"!
Inside Tent
Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided.
But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
I hear something's gonna fall from the sky?
You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway…
I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and start a new life.
If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that town across the river…
There was something glowing in that well over there.
If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!
When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing stones!
I got it out of the well. It must be a special rock!!
Hey? You can't hold anymore.
I'll keep it in my pocket for you. You can come by and pick it up later!
Received "Ultima" Materia!
Inside Ragged Hut
Because of them…ugh my husband got into that accident… He used to be such a strong man…
Is Meteor really going to crash down on us?
I'm still too young… I'll never remarry.
This memento is all I have left of my husband… I'll give it to you if you'll please stop Meteor…
How am I supposed to continue living in a town that lost everything?
To hell with the Mako reactor!
The town is in shambles… and Meteor is coming our way…
All we have left is our love for each other.
I don't want to die, but who can stop Meteor?
Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
Hey, what's a Meteor?
Received "Catastrophe"!
North Corel Inn
Welcome. It's 50 gil a night. Would you like a room?
Yes
No
North Corel Inn
Hmm, you don't quite have enough.
North Corel Inn
Enjoy your stay.
North Corel Inn
Please come again.
You all right?
Some townspeople carried you here so the Shinra wouldn't find you.
How much more will they have to destroy before they're satisfied!?
Isn't anyone brave enough to stick it to Shinra?
Ropeway Station
Ride the Ropeway?
Go on
Don't go on
Ride the Ropeway?
Yes
No
CLOUD
What happened?
CLOUD
Shinra troops? What for!?
CLOUD
Let's get on.
TIFA
That's so terrible!
TIFA
Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
TIFA
I never knew. BARRET never said a thing…
TIFA
…
We better go on!
TIFA
Everyone's… been through a lot of hardship…
BARRET
Sorry.
BARRET
My hometown used to be around here.
BARRET
It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried… in just 4 years.
BARRET
An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
BARRET
There was an explosion at a reactor.
Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
BARRET
Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I can't forgive myself.
Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor…
BARRET
That's why… that's why I get so pissed off!!
Not only did they take advantage of me… But I lost my wife, Myrna, too…
BARRET
Dyne was my best friend. We were close ever since we were kids…
BARRET
It's all my fault…
AERIS
BARRET, what happened?
AERIS
But how could those people say those terrible things?
AERIS
…
AERIS
Everything Shinra does seems to make everyone miserable…
RED XIII
What do you mean 'used to'?
RED XIII
…
YUFFIE
I'm not sympathizing with BARRET! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc.
YUFFIE
I'm waiting inside.
The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it.
Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!
The Gold Saucer is currently closed. The Ropeway's up and runnin', but there's no point in goin' there.
The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?
I'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits!
I know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then?
…My hometown, Corel's always
been a coal mining town.
It may be dusty and poor,
but it's calm…
It's a real small town.
That's the first time I ever heard
Mako Reactor mentioned since then…
We all dreamt of the good life.
Then, all of a sudden, Shinra troops came…
Village Headman
What are we going to do? The only one opposed to this is Dyne…
Dyne
I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!
Dyne
The coal's been ours for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it.
We have no right to throw it all away so easily!
BARRET
But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.
Scarlet
Right, everything is Mako, now.
It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed.
BARRET
Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.
Dyne
I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!
But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!
Village Headman
Dyne…you've got to understand.
That's how the Corel Reactor was built…and completed.
We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.
Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.
All the townspeople…
All my relatives……
Everyone…everything…
