CLOUD, you're late!
Yo man, you're late!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Guess everyone's here now.
So let's hear your story…
You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis of the Planet.
Let's hear it all.
…I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.
After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends.
You call that a friend?
Yeah, well…
He was older than me, and hardly ever talked about himself.
So I guess you'd call us war buddies… We trusted each other. Until one day…
…One day?
After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.
…that was five years ago.
I was 16…
It sure is raining hard.
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm all right.
I wouldn't know…
I've never had motion sickness.
Everything okay?
Sephiroth
Hey.
Settle down.
They gave me some new Materia.
I can't wait to use it.
…Just like a kid.
You going to brief us about this mission?
This isn't a typical mission.
Good!
Why do you say that?
I joined SOLDIER to be like you.
But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.
My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.
That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.
Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?
…I thought you wanted a briefing?
Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.
There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.
First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.
Brutal creatures? Where?
The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
Nibelheim…
That's where I'm from.
Hmm…hometown…
Sir…s, something strange just crashed into the truck!
That would be our Monster…
Come on, let's go to work.
Sephiroth's strength is incredible. He is far stronger in reality than any stories you may have heard about him.
So… Where do you come in?
Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
…and then we reached Nibelheim.
Nibelheim
How does it feel?
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?
So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown…
Ummm…how 'bout your parents?
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father…
What does it matter?
All right, let's go.
Yo wait a minute!!
Isn't that, uh…?
The name of Sephiroth's mother…
I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.
That's right.
BARRET, would you please let us hear what CLOUD has to say? You can ask questions later.
TIFA, I was only…
Ok CLOUD, continue.
The childhood friends are reunited!
…I was really surprised with TIFA.
The Mako smells pretty bad here.
Psst… (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
Being on watch is so boring.
You want to do what we always do?
Just sit tight, it's your job, right?
Shall we practice?
I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.
Practice? Oh, you mean practice my pose.
Do members of SOLDIER always have to worry about what others think?
How did it go?
…Was it like this?
Good job!
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
…The town was quiet.
Everyone must be in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters.
No, maybe they're afraid of us…
We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.
Oh, and…
You may visit your family and friends.
Man… I'm so nervous.
I'm excited.
Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?
…That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero…
Hey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation…
Hmm? You from Shinra?
That's right!
Who are you?
Geez… Big-headed young kid.
I'm the town's… …. …!?
Aren't you CLOUD?
Don't you know me?
You're TIFA's…
Right. I'm TIFA's father.
…Long time no see, sir.
TIFA's father
…Stay away from my daughter.
We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!
If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits…
I hate myself for asking you this, but…
Don't take your eyes off of TIFA! Hurry up and go back to her side!
Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.
I heard Sephiroth was coming so I brought my camera.
I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
Take my picture.
Get back in the house, it's dangerous.
I don't take pictures of nobodys.
All right… Fat-head…
Hey? This guy's a real…
You… Are you CLOUD?
Really? So that's how it is, huh?
Gosh, CLOUD, you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad.
Then take my picture
Let's do this, CLOUD. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth.
OK, OK… Fat-head… You're just his assistant.
Think they'd let me take a picture?
What's Sephiroth doing?
Once the guide gets here, we're heading out.
Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens…
…Trust me.
I'll be all right, Dad!
I have two men from SOLDIER with me.
I'm TIFA. Nice to meet you!
TIFA! You're the guide?
That's right.
It so happens I'm the number one guide in this town.
It's too dangerous! I can't get you involved in this!
There's no problem if you protect her.
…Let's go.
Umm…
Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!
TIFA, can you ask him for me too?
Great, thank you!
I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!
Cheeeeese!
This Mansion…
…No, I'll come here later.
Hey, stay over here!
Up ahead is…Mt. Nibel.
I'll tell you about the time I went into the mountains.
Hey, calm down! Wait over here.
…Late again.
I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep…
Zangan
There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?
Why?
No way!
…Why do you ask?
It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.
The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be embarrassing to the company.
You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.
…Oh my. You sure do have faith.
Is that you, CLOUD?
…Yeah
…No
Mom?
Here, I've brought you something!
Don't tell anyone in town!
Received "Homemade Potion!”
Nibelheim Inn
The, uh… The whole inn's booked up by Shinra for the night.
CLOUD?
Is it you, CLOUD?
It must've been two years.
Say, you've really moved up in the world, being under Sephiroth's command.
Wow…
This is really, somethin'.
You used to be such a scrawny kid, and now look at you!
So, what do you need, CLOUD?
Where's Sephiroth?
Give me a room
How is the town?
He's upstairs.
You STILL haven't found one yet?
It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?
Now about the town…
A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.
Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.
It was all right when they were building the reactor,
…while they were still building it.
But once it was completed, it's been bad.
Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.
I don't know if the reactor was good or bad…
I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But what can you do about it?
Anyhow, we've got to get rid of the monsters.
Then, we'll be able to relax a little bit.
I'll let you in on a secret…
The Shinra aren't really popular here.
You know what I mean, right?
You're from here, so you know.
It's the same story I always tell. You still want to hear it?
Yeah, tell me again
No, that's all right
Hey, you want to rest?
Yes, please
It's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest.
Hmmmm
Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.
I have 128 students all over the world!
In this town, a girl named TIFA is my student.
Did you say TIFA?
TIFA has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.
I want to see some Shinra techniques.
And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.
Well, good luck.
Will we be able to use this place, too?”
Oh? Did you come crying home?
I think you probably know better than I do, but…
Nibelheim Inn
…We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
It's still early.
Yeah, let's get some sleep.
…I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.
What are you looking at?
…This scenery… I feel like I know this place.
I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.
I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her…
It was the morning after that, right TIFA?
Yes, right…
We're short one bed…
This is…my house. It has nothing to do with what happened five years ago.
I can't…remember much else. There's…nothing more to talk about.
That's all right, CLOUD.
Yo wait, I wanna hear.
Me too! It's been a long time, right?
Tell us more!
You saw your family, right?
All right…
Well, I ain't gonna force ya…
I don't know if you'd call it a 'family'…
My father…died when I was still young.
That's why my mom…… lived alone in this house.
Yeah, I saw my mom.
My mom…she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all.
But a few days later, she died…
But when I saw her, she looked fine.
Yes?
Welcome home, CLOUD!
Hi, Mom.
Come, come… Let me take a look at you!
Hmmm…
You look so handsome.
So is this a SOLDIER uniform?
…Mom, I…
Are you eating right?
I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
Is that so?
I know you can't cook…
I've been worried sick about you.
CLOUD?
You know, CLOUD…
…isn't that right, CLOUD?
I'll always be your mother…
…Let's stop this…
TIFA's House
CLOUD?
Did you go in my house?
No…
I thought you might be home.
I remember you weren't there.
TIFA's House
Did you go into my room?
Received "Orthopedic Underwear!"
CLOUD!!!
Just kidding. Don't get mad.
…CLOUD
We're talking about something really important here.
The letter…
Did you read it? My letter?
I'd never do that!
Of course!
You remember what it said?
I don't remember
I remember clearly
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
Dear TIFA…
(Remember)
(Stop)
I read it…
It was a letter addressed to TIFA from the son of the guy that runs the General Store…
TIFA, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.
Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was CLOUD.
But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.
Well, enough about him.
CLOUD… Do you remember all of it?
No, that's it
Yeah, I remember
Because there was some stuff about me…
Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything… so out of it.
Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.
Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money.
…But, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first.  That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.
I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.
I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.
I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.
Hey, TIFA… Is that stupid old water tower still working?
Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?
And most of all, how are you, TIFA? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.
We were all talking about you last night.
Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.
I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.
Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!
So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.
P.S.  Write me back, okay?
Nibelheim House
…Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.
Making the rounds?
Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, CLOUD! I didn't recognize you.
Shinra----?
Chinra---?
SOLDIER?
SALTZA?
Are you going to kill the monsters?
Are you going to…?
….
These kids are also Sephiroth fans…
He's soooo cool!!
Way cool!!
CLOUD, you've grown up to be a strong man.
Do your best.
Do your best.
Nibelheim Item Store
Welcome.
Hey? Aren't you…?
…Have I been here before? …I don't remember.
Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!
Oh, oh, you're…
A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel.
The cold mountain air of Mt. Nibel
was the same…
It gets harder from here! Follow me!
I'm all right. You be careful too, Guide.
Let's hurry.
Uh…the bridge!!
Everyone seems to be all right. Will we be able to get back?
These caves are intertwined, like an ant farm…
Oh, and Sephiroth… One person seems to be missing…
It may sound cruel, but we've no time to search for him. We can't go back, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.
What's this?
A mysteriously colored cave…
It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
…And what's this?
A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
It's so beautiful…
If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too…
Materia. When you condense Mako energy, Materia is produced.
It's very rare to see Materia in its natural state.
By the way… Why is it that when you use Materia you can also use magic, too?
You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?
…the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the Materia.
Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the Planet calling up magic…or so they say.
Magic…a mysterious power…
Ha, ha, ha !
Did I say somethin' funny?
A man once told me never to use unscientific terms like 'mysterious power'! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'!
I still remember how angry he was.
Who was that?
Hojo of Shinra, Inc…. An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist.
He was a walking mass of complexes.
A Mako fountain… So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
TIFA, you wait here.
I'm going inside, too! I wanna see!
Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
But!
Take care of the lady.
Mm, man!
Better take real good care of me, then!
Yeah, I remember.
Hmm…so it was you?
This is…Jenova, right? It won't open…
This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken.
CLOUD, close the valve.
Did you close the valve?
Why did it break?
…Now I see, Hojo.
But doing this will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast.
This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy… that is, when it's working correctly.
Now…what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?
Uh, umm…Oh yeah!  It becomes a Materia.
Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. …Take a look.
Look through the window.
Wh…what is this!?
Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako.
You're different from the others but still human.
But, what are they? They've been exposed to a far higher degree of Mako than you.
…Is this some kind of monster?
Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters.
Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monsters really are.
Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
H…hey, Sephiroth!
No…
…Was I?
…Was I created this way, too?
…Sephiroth.
Am I the same as all these monsters?
You saw it! All of them…were humans…
Human!? No way!
…Ever since I was small I've felt…
…that I was different from the others. Special, in some way.
But… not like this…
Am I…human?
I didn't really understand what Sephiroth meant then.
I was even more surprised that Shinra was producing monsters.
Yeah, maybe so. Wanna take a breather here?
Hmph! Pokin' his damn nose in where it don't belong. CLOUD! Why don't you finish that story?
(Phew……)
(Why you talkin' to me!?)
Save game and take a rest
Keep talking
…I get it.
That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.
I think we should listen carefully to CLOUD. Don't you think so BARRET?
Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
…Who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held such a secret.
TIFA… Were you waiting outside then?
…Yes.
We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself to the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
The villagers used to call it the Shinra mansion.
Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion…
There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room…
Sephiroth seems different.
