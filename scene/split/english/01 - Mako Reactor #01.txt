Who goes there!?
C'mon newcomer. Follow me.
Biggs
Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! …Not everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE.
Jessie
SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?
Jessie
What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?
Biggs
He WAS in SOLDIER, Jessie.
But he quit and is with us now.
Biggs
Didn't catch your name…
CLOUD
…CLOUD.
Biggs
CLOUD, eh? I'm…
CLOUD
I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over…I'm outta here.
The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a group!
Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge in front of it.
Ex-SOLDIER, huh? I don't trust ya!
BARRET
Press the Directional buttons while pushing [CANCEL] to run.
Wedge
I'll secure our escape passage. You concentrate on the mission, CLOUD.
Wedge
Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace up? This'll be somethin' to see!
Switch On.
Jessie
Push that button over there!
BARRET
Now let's go into the reactor! From here on out, you stick with me.
Leave this to me!
Don't mess up SOLDIER-boy!
Bring BARRET back alive!
BARRET
Yo! This your first time in a reactor?
CLOUD
No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know.
BARRET
The Planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it everyday.
However, nobody knows the truth about Mako. Do you know?
BARRET
It's the life blood of this Planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines.
CLOUD
I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just do it.
BARRET
@#&^%$!
From now on you come with me.
BARRET
Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. Then that'll be that.
BARRET
The planet's dyin', CLOUD!
CLOUD
It's not my problem.
CLOUD
The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before security and the Roboguards come.
BARRET
…
Jessie
Code deciphered
Biggs
Code deciphered
Can't decipher code without Biggs
Can't decipher code without Jessie
CLOUD
You all right?
Jessie
My leg got stuck.
Jessie
Thanks!
Biggs
I only let my guard down for a minute… And someone got behind me…
Jessie
Biggs and I got the code for this door.
Biggs
Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this code…
Jessie
Push [OK] in front of a ladder to grab on to it. Then use the [Directional button] to climb up and down.
Jessie
There you go!
Biggs
Let's go!
Jessie
Alright, be careful.
Biggs
Jessie still isn't back yet!
BARRET
When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk.
BARRET
CLOUD, you set the bomb.
CLOUD
Shouldn't you do it?
BARRET
Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.
CLOUD
Fine, be my guest.
Watch out!
This isn't just a reactor!!
BARRET
What's wrong?
CLOUD
Huh?
BARRET
What's wrong, CLOUD? Hurry it up!
CLOUD
…Yeah, sorry.
BARRET
Heads up, here they come!
CLOUD

CLOUD

BARRET
Damn straight.
BARRET
TIFA's old friend… That ain't good enough.
TIFA

Biggs
That should keep the planet going… at least a little longer.
Wedge
Yeah.
BARRET

Jessie

You'd better get out of here
Nothing…hey…
Flower girl

CLOUD

Don't see many flowers around here
Never mind
Flower girl
What! Tell me!
Flower girl
Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only one gil.
Buy one
Forget it
Flower girl
Uh, excuse me, would you like to buy some flowers? They're only one gil.
Flower girl
Oh, thank you!
Flower girl
Here you are!
Flower girl
Ahh…not again.
What an explosion!
Think it's another Mako reactor accident?
Sector 8
Just what the hell's going on!?
Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see…
Don't be fooled by Shinra!
Mako energy doesn't last forever!
Mako is the Planet's life source!
The end is in sight!
