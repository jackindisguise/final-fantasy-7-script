Elmyra
CLOUD…wasn't it?
Elmyra
Well now, make yourselves at home.
Elmyra
It's about AERIS, isn't it?
CLOUD
…Sorry. The Shinra have her.
Elmyra
I know. They took her from here.
CLOUD
They were here?
Elmyra
That's what AERIS wanted…
CLOUD
Why is Shinra after AERIS?
Elmyra
AERIS is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
BARRET
What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
Elmyra
Not her real mother. …it must have been 15 years ago…
Elmyra
…during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.
One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave.
You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war.
Her last words were, Please take AERIS somewhere safe.
My husband never came back. I had no child. I was lonely. So I decided to take her home with me.
AERIS and I became close very quickly. That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything.
She told me how she escaped from some kind of research laboratory, and that her mother had already returned to the Planet, so she wasn't lonely…many other things.
BARRET
Returned to the Planet?
Elmyra
I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky,
but she said it was this Planet… She was a mysterious child in many ways.
AERIS
Mom.
AERIS
Please don't cry.
Elmyra
AERIS just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened…
AERIS
Someone dear to you has just died.
His spirit was coming to see you, but he's already returned to the Planet.
Elmyra
At that time I didn't believe her.
Elmyra
But…
Elmyra
Several days later… we received a notice saying my husband died…
Elmyra
…and that was it.
A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day…
Tseng
We want you to return AERIS to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
AERIS
No! Never!
Tseng
AERIS, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.
Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
Elmyra
At that moment, I found out she was an 'Ancient'.
Tseng
The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.
AERIS will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.
That is why Shinra would like AERIS's cooperation.
AERIS
He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
Tseng
But AERIS, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?
AERIS
No, I don't!
Elmyra
But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers.
She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed.
CLOUD
It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years…
Elmyra
The Shinra need her, so I guess they wouldn't harm her.
TIFA
But why now?
Elmyra
She brought a little girl here with her.
Tseng found them on their way here. She probably wasn't fast enough to get away.
She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.
CLOUD
…Marlene.
BARRET
Marlene!! AERIS was caught because of Marlene!?
BARRET
I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm really sorry…
Elmyra
You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
BARRET
…Please don't start with that. I'm always thinkin' about what might happen to Marlene, if I…
BARRET
But you gotta understand somethin'… …I don't got any answers. I wanna be with Marlene… But I gotta fight.
BARRET
'Cause if I don't…the Planet's gonna die.
BARRET
So I'm gonna keep fightin'!
BARRET
But inside I'm always thinkin' of her. I just wanna be with her…always.
BARRET
See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
Elmyra
…I think I know what you mean. She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her?
TIFA
It's my fault… I was the one who got AERIS involved in this.
Elmyra
Don't say that. AERIS doesn't think so.
TIFA
I feel so depressed.
Elmyra
…sigh…
BARRET
CLOUD!
BARRET
I'm so glad… I'm so glad you're all right…
Marlene
Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!
BARRET
You gonna go help AERIS, right? She's done so much for me…
BARRET
If the Shinra're involved, I ain't stayin' here! I'm comin', too!
Marlene
Guess what? Guess what? AERIS asked me lots of questions.
Like what kind of person CLOUD is. I bet she likes you, CLOUD!
I don't know
Let's hope so
Marlene
Dummy!
Marlene
I won't tell TIFA.
CLOUD
Looks like I can rest here.
Sleep
Don't want to sleep
Received "Potion"!
Received "Ether"!
Received "Phoenix Down"!
AERIS's House
Marlene
Daddy, TIFA, CLOUD! Please bring AERIS back!
TIFA
You're going after AERIS, right?
TIFA
I'm coming with you.
CLOUD
We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. …You gotta be prepared for the worst.
TIFA
I know.
TIFA
Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.
TIFA
If I stayed here…I'd go crazy.
BARRET
Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
Elmyra
Yes, I don't mind.
BARRET
This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
Elmyra
…You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
Elmyra
I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
AERIS's House
Received "Ether"!
Received "Cover" Materia!
TIFA
How do we get to the Shinra Building?
BARRET
There ain't no train that goes up there anymore…
TIFA
…
TIFA
Well, let's go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.
Wall Market
Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary…Brrr.
Oh man! This is horrible…
Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
TIFA
Can we climb it?
Yeah. It leads to the upper world.
BARRET
Alright! We'll climb the wire!
CLOUD
There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
BARRET
There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
CLOUD
Just a normal wire.
BARRET
Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
You're right. This is the only way to save AERIS…
CLOUD
OK, that was a bad analogy, but, BARRET, I understand how you feel.
CLOUD
Let's go!
Plate Section
CLOUD
…Maybe if I put a battery in…
The propeller might work.
CLOUD
It might work if I put a battery in it.
CLOUD
I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.
CLOUD
Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar.
Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use [OK] to jump)
CLOUD
Jumped too soon…
CLOUD
Jumped too late…
CLOUD
Need a battery here, too.
CLOUD
Damn, out of batteries…
Shinra Bldg.
Shinra Bldg. Stairs
BARRET
Yo… You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
TIFA
Well we've got to get to AERIS to help her somehow.
BARRET
Of all the out of the way…
TIFA
I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!
BARRET
Y, yo TIFA! Don't go alone!
TIFA
Wait a minute, CLOUD!
Shinra Bldg. Stairs
BARRET
Don't know… why…the hell… we gotta…climb…
CLOUD
…because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved AERIS.
CLOUD
If that's possible…
BARRET
…heh heh heh.
CLOUD
Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
BARRET
So even you will fight for someone else. Guess I figured you wrong.
CLOUD
Who cares what you figured!
BARRET
I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong…
TIFA
heh heh heh……
CLOUD
What's that supposed to mean, TIFA?
BARRET
…how much farther do these stairs go on?
TIFA
Why don't you ask them?
BARRET
It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', is it?
TIFA
Of course not!!
BARRET
Right…couldn't be that…
BARRET
Are we there yet?
TIFA
Not yet.
BARRET
…there yet?
TIFA
I said not yet!
BARRET
Yo…
TIFA
Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there, OK!?
BARRET
Yo… What floor is this?
TIFA
…I stopped counting.
BARRET
Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?
BARRET
That Shinra… They're just no damn good.
TIFA
…
BARRET
…huff… Man, I'm beat…
BARRET
Marlene, daddy wanted to see your face one more time…
TIFA
Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?
TIFA
It's just a bit more!
TIFA
…maybe.
BARRET
Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!
TIFA
It'll take just as long to go down as it did to come up.
BARRET
…
TIFA
C'mon, BARRET. Pull it together!
BARRET
Yeah well, all I know is I'm only flesh 'n' blood… cept for this arm of mine.
Don't treat me like I'm some ex-SOLDIER or somethin'…
TIFA
What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!
TIFA
…?
TIFA
Yaah! BARRET! You go first!
BARRET
What're ya ignorant?  …I didn't mean that
TIFA
All right, all right!
TIFA
CLOUD, you go on ahead too!!

Shinra Bldg.
BARRET
Hey, you oughta know this building well.
TIFA
What's wrong?
CLOUD
…Not really, now that I think about it, this's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters.
BARRET
I heard about this place before.
Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees.
Must be where they took AERIS.
The security's pretty light now. Alright, let's go!!
TIFA
Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?
BARRET
Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and…
TIFA
That's not going to work! We've got to find another way…
BARRET
Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, AERIS'll…
TIFA
I know that! But if we get caught here…
Hey, CLOUD. …What should we do?
Let's bust on in!
Let's sneak in quietly
BARRET
That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!
TIFA
See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
CAIT SITH
No, no! The Sister Ray's not this way!
Shinra Bldg. 1f. lobby
Receptionist
Excuse me! If you don't have an appointment, you'll have to…
BARRET
I don't need no appointment… This is a 'mergency!
And anyone who don't wanna get their face bashed in better git outta the way!!
Yaagghh!
Who do they think they are?
D, do you think they're AVALANCHE?
Intruders! Seize them!!
BARRET
Let's go to the top!

Shinra Bldg. 2f. Shop
Honey…would you buy me that car!

Hh, hey!

Please take all purchases to the register
Welcome. Our special today is…
Eagghhh!!

BARRET
I don't want your money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals.
We jus' want back what your boss stole from us.
BARRET
I don't want your money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals.
We jus' want back what your boss stole from us.
I mean, "who" he stole from us.
A, AVALANCHE?
BARRET
We ain't gonna hurt you. We might even pay ya, if ya help us.
Ok…ok…well…
What is it?
Thank you and come again… Forget I said that.
Welcome… to the fully automated store. Place your order…now.
Received "Pile Bunker"!
Received "Master Fist"!
You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait!
BARRET
This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
CLOUD
…I don't know. Now that you mention it, this's my first time at headquarters. What about you?
BARRET
…I been here before. Back when I still had both my hands.
TIFA
I hope AERIS is all right.
TIFA
AERIS… She's been through a lot, huh.
Yeah
You too, TIFA
TIFA
…What's wrong?
CLOUD
I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved AERIS.
I should have known that was impossible though…
BARRET
Heh, heh, heh.
CLOUD
What is it? You're givin' me the willies.
BARRET
So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.
CLOUD
Who cares if you're impressed?
BARRET
Y'know, I ain't so good at sayin' this but… Sorry…for…lots of things.
BARRET
Wh, what the!?
TIFA
Look!
BARRET
DA-MN!
BARRET
Just stop it, CLOUD! I don't care where!
TIFA
What's going on!?
Oh man!!
No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on.
Oh man!!
You…again?  Uh, I'll pass.
Elevator
Shinra Bldg. 59f.
BARRET
Hey CLOUD!
We come this far, and you're thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?
Yeah
No…
BARRET
No time for that now! Stop messin' around, boy!
BARRET
Yeah, that's right! Let's go on!
Destroy the intruders!
CLOUD
What's this?
Received Key Item "Keycard 60"!
Shinra Bldg. 60f.
What're you doing here? Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed here!!
Your kind don't belong here! Go on, get out!
Hey there! What do you think you're doing there?
BARRET
Look at all them guards runnin' around.
CLOUD, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to move.
TIFA
Stay in the shadows!
BARRET
When those guards turn around, MOVE!
BARRET
What the hell're ya doin'? Man, you gotta do it again!
BARRET
OK! We gonna rock!
TIFA
Remember, we're here to save AERIS.
BARRET
Hell, I know that!
BARRET
I shoulda known it'd turn out like this…
If I knew it'd be like this in the first place…
TIFA
Shhh! Now let's move on.
Wait for the soldiers to turn, then push [OK] to signal the others!
