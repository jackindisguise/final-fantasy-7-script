The road splits into two. We'll split into two groups.
Another fork in the road…
Well, which way?
Left
Right
CLOUD, which way you goin'?
CLOUD, which way should we go?
Which way are we going, CLOUD?
CLOUD, which way are you goin'?
What do we do now, CLOUD?

Which you gonna choose, CLOUD?
All right, then I'll go…
Then, I'm going…

Well… which way should I go…?

Down
Which way are we headed, CLOUD?
What now, CLOUD?
Now don't any of you die on me. …
Gotta get through to Sephiroth!
This will be the end of it!
Well…looks like this is our last big job!
Let's all go back alive, okay?
All life on this Planet, indeed the very life of this Planet, is in our hands…
Oh man… "Materia Hunter YUFFIE" sounds like the last chapter of Materia Forever.'
I'm so happy to have met you all, really! …sniff…
It's all over now. With this…
I'll destroy that Sephiroth before anyone gets to him!
Ain't no way I'm gonna die until I stick this into that guy.
After this, we can go home. All of us…
We're not the only ones fighting.
The Planet's fighting too!
If I knew THIS was gonna happen, I'd have bailed out sooner!
There's nothing to worry about. We're all in this together!
Let's go…
Sephiroth's probably crapping his pants right about now…
Wait! Sephiroth…
We'll leave this to BARRET.
We'll leave this to CID.
We'll leave this to RED XIII.
We'll leave this to CAIT SITH.
We'll leave this to VINCENT.
We'll leave this to YUFFIE.
We'll leave this to TIFA.
We'll try to go down from the other side.
Empty!
Received "Magic Counter" Materia!
Received "MegaAll"!
Hey, were you thinking of leaving me?
Yo, we're a bit late?
Don't leave us, CLOUD.
I can't let you guys go by yourselves, you'll make me worry.
I finally got here, so I'm not leaving…
You sure are hasty.
You're so cruel, CLOUD.
Where's TIFA?
Where's BARRET?
Where's CID?
Where's RED XIII?
Where's CAIT SITH?
Where's YUFFIE?

Bottom of Northern Cave
This is the center of the Planet?
Sephiroth is beyond here?'
CLOUD, look.
Received "Hero Drink"!
This is it.
Here, CLOUD.
Received "Guard Source"!
Alright, this's the last dance!
CLOUD, I found this…
CLOUD… Seems like you got too much Materia.
We finally made it here.
Hey, CLOUD, I found this on the way.
Let's just get this over with!
Hey, CLOUD, I found this.
Well, shall we get goin'?
Hold on to this.
Received "MegaAll" Materia!
No, first organize your Materia. You have too much.
Hmm… Being with you all isn't so bad.
… Wh…what?
By the way YUFFIE, didn't you find something?
Oh yeah, YUFFIE, didn't you find somethin'?
By the way YUFFIE, didn't you find something on the way?
Yeah, YUFFIE, didn't you pick up something on the way?
By the way, YUFFIE, didn't you pick up something?
YUFFIE, just let CLOUD have it.
But I'm the one who found it, so you better give it back to me when you're done with it!
Hey!? But you have lots of Materia! Then you won't need it.
It feels like we made it as far as we can.
Let's get going
(No, not yet…)
All right, everyone, let's mosey.
Damn! Again!
Stop sayin' it like a wimp!
Can't you say "Move out!" or somethin'?
Move out!!
Look at the number…
%#@^! They're comin' out in full force!
CLOUD! You go first!
OK, I'm going alone.
Shu'up! It won't do us no good wit' everyone back here!
BARRET's right.
You take two of us with you and go first. The rest'll catch up with ya later.
Is this like a practice run before the final battle?
Yeah, a major practice run…
I'm fine with that. (It's probably more fun than meeting Sephiroth down there.)
Hmm, this might be fun to pass time.
They're coming! They're already on the floor next to us!
CLOUD! Hurry up and make up your mind!
All of you!
Later!
Yeah, later.
Yup! Later!
We'll meet up later.
Inside the Planet
Where are we?
What's that!?
What?
What the hell?
What?
What? What?
What's this?
Jenova?
It's coming!!
Li…ght…
A light…
Is this…
Is this light…Holy?
CID!?
Owww…
Goddammit… So we're all here?
What? So everyone's together again?
Owwww…
CLOUD… So are we all together?
…And, where the hell's that?
Uuuugh!!
Sephiroth!!
Ugh! Is this… Sephiroth's power?
My…my body… I can't control my body… Uuugh!?
Sephi…roth! Not yet… I'm not…Uuuuraagh!
My front legs…my hind legs… my tail's about to rip off!!
This is definitely not good… He's way outta our league…
I, I don't know if I can…go on.
CLOUD… CLOUD…
Ugh…ugh…
…There…
It's…there…
…Holy…Holy… is there…
Holy Materia is shining… AERIS's prayer is shining!
Holy… AERIS…
It's not over yet… This isn't the end yet!!
Uuuuuaaaaagh!!
Eeeyaaaa!!
Let's go, everyone!
Just a moment!
AERIS's memories… Our memories…
We came…to tell you…our memories… Come Planet! Show us your answer!
And Sephiroth!! To the settling of everything!!
Not only AERIS…
Holy is the prayer of AVALANCHE… Of Marlene and Dyne… And everyone on the Planet!
AERIS is here… everyone is here… CLOUD is here with us!
There's still a lot for us to do… I'm not giving up!!
I'm going to see it through to the end. For our future… And that of the Planet…
I understand now, Grandpa. This is my mission!
I won't let the Lifestream… or the Planet wither away!!
Hoo-ok! I can't be foolin' around in this hell hole…
I still have lots of stuff to do with my life!
We noticed a little late the trouble we were getting in…
But, there's still time… We can still get out of it! Even if we can't get EVERYTHING back to normal!
We should be able to protect what's most important!!
Maybe…maybe I shouldn't have come…
I don't need…Materia……any…
Nope, I still want it!! This an' that an' everything…MINE! And I'm never gonna give any up!!
I was frozen in time… But now I feel as though my time is finally beginning!
Sephiroth, now it's your time to sleep for the ages!!
Urrrrrgh!!
…We're not gonna lose!!
…No way we're gonna lose!!
This ain't nothin'!!
We're not losin'!!
I don't like it!!
…over…
It's all over…
…everything…
Everyone…everything…
all finished…
Now everything
will begin anew…with me!!
This is all we could do.
Wait! What about Holy? What's gonna happen to the Planet?
That…I don't know. Isn't the rest up to the Planet?
…You're right.
We've done all that we could do.
All right, everyone.
We did our best.
That's it.
Let's go home proud.
…I feel it…
What…
He is still…here.
Still…
He's…laughing…
……..Lifestream?
…. I think I'm beginning to understand.
An answer from the planet… the Promised Land…
I think I can meet her … there
Yeah, let's go meet her.
Hey, where is everyone?
Heeeey!
I'm glad you're all safe!
They all seem to be safe, too.
But… now what're we going to do?
Holy should be moving soon,
and that means this place will…
Oh, Lady Luck don't fail me now…
Shit!!
The flower girl?
Wait a damn minute!
What's gonna happen to Midgar?
We can't let that happen!
I had everyone take refuge in the slums,
but the way things are now…
It's too late for Holy.
Meteor is approaching the Planet.
Holy is having the opposite effect.
Forget Midgar, we've gotta worry about the Planet,
What's that!?
What the hell IS that…….?
…….. Lifestream.
It's coming.
Five hundred years later…
