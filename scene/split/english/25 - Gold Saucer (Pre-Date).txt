Weapon seller
Huh? Oh another customer. You sure picked an out of the way place but…
But if it's the 'Keystone' you're looking for, you're too late. Don't have it.
CLOUD
Keystone?
What? You didn't come here for that?
The 'Keystone' is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere.  “You're not going to believe your ears,
but I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!
CLOUD
The Temple of the Ancients?
Ha, hah, hah, hah…
Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!
Huh? What?
Where is the Temple?
Let's change the subject
Never mind
I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really want to sell it but…
That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not be a good idea NOT to sell it to him…
CLOUD
Who did you sell it to?
The manager of the Gold Saucer. think his name was 'Dio'. Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here.
Come on…it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure would be something, huh?
Now that you mention it, I've heard of something called Ultimate Destruction Magic It's supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the Ancients.
CLOUD
Ultimate Destruction Magic…?
Come on! I said don't take it seriously!
Hey, don't just come bargin' in here!
You again? All right, what is it?
Huh? What? If it's the Keystone you want I already sold it!
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials…
Hey you wouldn't happen to have any Mythril on you, would you? I'll trade you something good if you could spare some.
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials…
Give him some
Forget it
Hey thanks! All right you can help yourself to either a big or small box.
Yeah? Well, guess that's that.
Received "Gold Armlet"!
Received "Great Gospel"!
CLOUD

What? You want to rest?

Nope

Heh, heh, heh. Long time no see, boy. Hmm? You like that, huh?
Dio
I got it from the guy in a little shack south of here, past the 'River'.
Dio
If you want to know more, go there and talk to him.
CLOUD
Can you let me borrow this?
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.
Dio
Hmm.
Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition.
CLOUD
One condition?
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!
What do I gotta do?
Not in the mood.
Dio
Hoo boy!
Dio
I see… Then let's pretend that this never happened.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh! So! You want the Keystone, right? How 'bout entertaining me first?
What do I gotta do?
Not in the mood.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Nothing all that difficult.
This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just you, boy. I'm expecting a good fight!

That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go ahead, take it.
Dio
Hmm, you did pretty well, young man!
Good, it's a promise, so go ahead and take it. I'll give this to you too.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh! Well done, young man! And, as I promised, you can take it. Oh, and I'll give you this too.

AERIS
With this, We can get into the Temple of the Ancients. Let's go, CLOUD!
TIFA
With this Key Materia, We can get in to the Temple of the Ancients. Let's go, CLOUD!
BARRET
This'll get us into the Temple of the Ancients, right?
Staff
Excuse me, sir.
Staff
I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now.
CLOUD
…So?
Staff
I'm really sorry!
Staff
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired.
CAIT SITH
What's wrong?
CAIT SITH
Too bad. It happens, though.
CAIT SITH
I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go talk to them.
Staff
I will let you know once the repairs are completed.
AERIS
Are you thinking of just us going back?
TIFA
Hey, CLOUD, Are we going back without the others?
RED XIII
Are we leaving the others?
YUFFIE
CLOUD! Are we just going to leave the others?
CAIT SITH
We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?
CAIT SITH
CLOUD, how 'bout it? Can you tell me what's happened so far?
I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning.
CID
Yeah! I'm for that!
VINCENT
Good idea.
BARRET
I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.
BARRET
CLOUD, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!
I'm tired…
All right, I'll give it a shot…
CID
All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about?
CLOUD
Phew…
CLOUD
We are going after Sephiroth.
Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land.
CID
The Promised Land?
CLOUD
A land full of Mako energy. …Or at least that's what the Shinra believe.
I don't know if it actually exists.
AERIS
The Cetras will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.
BARRET
Cetra? That some kinda disease?
AERIS
That's what the Ancients call themselves.
Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?
AERIS
…You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.
AERIS
You search and travel, until you feel it. Then you just know that you've found it.
CLOUD
AERIS…can you feel it too?
AERIS
I think so.
TIFA
So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?
AERIS
He's searching for that, and one other thing.
CLOUD
The Black Materia?
CAIT SITH
I heard from Dio that a man in a black cape was lookin' for the Black Materia.
TIFA
I've never heard of Black Materia…
TIFA
How many men with black capes and number tattoos are there?
RED XIII
…You know, of course, my tattoo is number 13.
CLOUD
How did you get that tattoo?
RED XIII
…Hojo put it on me. The rest are just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo.
TIFA
So there are at least 13!?
AERIS
You know…
AERIS
I think Hojo did something to those men in the black capes.
But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though…
AERIS
That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.
BARRET
Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'.
AERIS
And…
AERIS
I'm sorry, forget it!
AERIS
I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.
CAIT SITH
What was that, all of a sudden!?
YUFFIE
What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed!
CAIT SITH
Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?
CLOUD
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
BARRET
Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!
RED XIII
CLOUD…
RED XIII
I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?
TIFA
I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?
RED XIII
But…
TIFA
Be strong.
RED XIII
But, I…
TIFA
Stop it, RED XIII! Be strong!
CLOUD
TIFA?
TIFA
You're not the only one who's worried!
CAIT SITH
I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation…
VINCENT
Hey CID, let's go back to our rooms.
CID
…zzzz…zzzz…
