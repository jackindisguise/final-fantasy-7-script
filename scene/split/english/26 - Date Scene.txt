I thought about what I was going to say, but, it's kinda embarrassing…
Hey, CLOUD! Why don't the two of us sneak out of here and spend some time together?

Beautiful Girl
Thank…you. You've released me…from the spell and I am my normal self again…
Oh, that was fun. Hey, let's go on the Gondola.
Hmm, that was funny. Hey, let's go on the Gondola next.
I didn't get it. CLOUD, let's go on the Gondola next.
Let's go somewhere where we can talk, in private.
Two, please.
Two, please.
Two.
Hey! You gotta be kiddin'! Just us two? …ok, that's cool, I guess…
Yo. Two.
Here you are, two tickets.
Inside the Ferris Wheel
Look, there.
Look, look.
Wow.
CLOUD!
Geez!
Oh my gawd!
Oh, how pretty.
Look, CLOUD.
Oh, CLOUD.
Wow, how nice.
Oh! Look, CLOUD.
It's so pretty.
Geez!!
Wait a minute.
…it's really pretty, isn't it?
Ok, I'm going to just go ahead and say it…
…What?
AERIS would be able to just come out and say it, probably.
Sometimes being old friends is hard.
I mean, timing is everything.
CLOUD…?
I…
…. ….
…Beautiful, isn't it?
……first off, it bothered me how you looked exactly alike.
Two completely different people, but look exactly the same.
The way you walk, gesture…
I think I must have seen him again, in you…
But you're different.
Things are different…
CLOUD…
I'm searching for you.
…?
I want to meet you.
But I'm right here.
I know, I know…what I mean is…
I want to meet…you.
Hey spike-head. What'd you wanna see fireworks with me for?
Not having fun?
You should've asked one of them!
Which would you have asked?
Oh man, there just ain't no choice!
TIFA, AERIS.
Ah, YUFFIE?
(hoo boy)
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Hey, you don't mean…Marlene?
NO WAY! Forget it!
There ain't no way I'm lettin' a wacko like you anywhere near my little Marlene!
She's my baby. My prized possession.
…Marlene.
Wish I could've brought Marlene here. She'd love the fireworks.
Why the hell do I gotta be here with a jackass like you!
…The more I think bout it the madder I get!
Damn fireworks anyways.
Shut up!!
No I, uh…
I just felt like doing that.
That's all.
H, hey!! Say something, why don't you!
…gawd, I could just die.
Say something, PLEASE!
…something.
There's no time for this! We have to go after CAIT SITH.
There's no time to waste. Let's hurry and go after CAIT SITH!
Should we be wasting time like this? Weren't we going after CAIT SITH?
The hell're you doin'!? We're goin' after CAIT SITH!
CLOUD I really had fun tonight.
By the way, what did you want to say a minute ago?
N, nothing!
Nothing…
?
Oh, look at the time. We should be getting back.
I had fun tonight. Let's do it again.
Don't you like being with me?
That's not it
Oh, don't tease me like that!
I'm glad.
Next time we come, let's take our time and go on more rides.
Oh, look at the time. We'd better get going.
Oh man I'm beat. Let's head back.
I should sleep really well tonight.
Thanks… for coming with me.
You wanna go back, CLOUD?
Hey? What's CAIT SITH doing?
That's…CAIT SITH. He's acting strange.
…it's CAIT SITH. What's he doin' so quietly?
Hey, isn't that CAIT SITH? What's he doing?
Is that the…Keystone?
Hey! CAIT SITH!
Oh oh!
Come on, let's go.
Come on, let's go.
CLOUD, let's go.
CLOUD, wanna take a peek?
We've got no time for this! Let's go after CAIT SITH!
We've got no time to relax. Let's go after CAIT SITH!
Is it all right to relax like that? Aren't we going after CAIT SITH?
We don't have time for this! We've got to go after CAIT SITH.
There's no time for this. Let's hurry after CAIT SITH!
Hey! Look here! The Key Materia!
Well done.
W, w, wait a second. I won't run or hide.
Yes‚I was a spy. I was hired by the Shinra.
Don't mess with us!
…I trusted you. I can't believe you!
BARRET
Ya dirty &*$*%$!
You think this's a big joke!?
I can't help it. What's done is done. That's just the way it is.
How 'bout if we go on like nothing ever happened?
You're pushin' it‚CAIT SITH! You gotta lot of nerve staying with us all the while being a spy!
Then‚what are you goin' to do? Destroy me?
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.
So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
Who the hell are ya!? What's your real name!?
Part of the Shinra! Who the *&$# are you!?
Whoa‚I can't tell you my name.
We're not gettin' anywhere.
Right? I told you! Talking won't do any good‚so can't we just continue our journey?
…Alright‚yes‚I am a Shinra employee.
But we're not completely enemies.
…Something bothers me. I think it's you're ways of living
You don't get paid You don't get praised. And yet you still risk your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me…
It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too good if things ended the way it is now.
You're lying again.
…And so on‚and so on…
Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
Sounds fishy---
He won't come clean. And he won't quit being a spy.
We can't go on with someone like that. Pull your head out!
…I thought so. It won't do any good talking to you.
So‚I've prepared myself in case something like this happened.
Why don't you listen to this.
Dad! TIFA!
Marlene!
Hey! That's Marlene!
Ma…Marlene!?
…Marlene?
Hey! It's dad! Dad! It's me‚Marlene!
Hey! It's TIFA! TIFA! You know what!
Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady…
Hey! It's CLOUD!
…So‚there's no other way but to listen to me.
You're the lowest…
I didn't want to do this either. Not by using dirty tricks and taking hostages…
So‚this is how it is. There's no room for compromises. So why don't we go on as we did.
Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients‚right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.
Of course we'll get there after the Shinra‚ but you'll have to deal with that.
…Well‚we're stuck… We'll have to do what he says.
…Marlene.
I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to Mom?
Sorry‚CLOUD.
Uh‚yup.
Hey! Over here! The Keystone!
See? I told you! Talking won't do any good, so can't we just continue our journey?
Hey! It's CLOUD!
Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.
Oh, you didn't seem to know this, but…
The Keystone is the key to the Temple of the Ancients. Even so, you're all going, right?
I know where it is, so I'll show you later.
I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to Mom?
