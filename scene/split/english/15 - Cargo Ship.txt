Cargo Ship
YUFFIE
Urrrgh… This is why…I hate ships.
Hey, CLOUD. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?
Here, use this
Nope
YUFFIE
Thanks… Gross…this is bitter.
YUFFIE
…Unless it's an emergency get away from me.
YUFFIE
Ugh, you don't have any?
…Unless it's an emergency get away from me.
YUFFIE
Where are the others?
I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?
How should I know…?  Ugh…urk…
…the Engine Room… …a suspicious…character…
No…there's no way… that…not a human… That thing's not human.
…
Hey, get to work!
Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!
If we do good, we could get promoted!
Umm…It's me AERIS.
AERIS
Hey, CLOUD. Did you see the Airship at Junon?
CLOUD
…I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big.
AERIS
That was REALLY something.
Hey, do you think I could get on it?
I'll take you someday
I dunno…
CLOUD
…It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.
AERIS
…Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.
AERIS
Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.
CLOUD
…Keep hoping.
AERIS
Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!
AERIS
Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!
AERIS
Hey, CLOUD. Did you see BARRET?
I hope he's not doing anything stupid…
It won't do any good trying to stop me!
All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
Geez… What chance for a promotion.
The only one who's gonna benefit from this is the Chief, anyway.
It has nothing to do with us workers.
I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?
The new President's probably the same. He's just gonna order us around anyway.

BARRET
Look, CLOUD. It's Rufus and Heidegger.
They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em…
BARRET
Ummmm… Gmmmmm…
How can he… Goin' off laughin' like that?
Because of him, Biggs, Wedge, Jessie…
Ggggggggh… Ggggh… Ggggggghhh!!
BARRET
God!! I can't take it anymore!
I'm gonna settle things here and now!
Emergency alert! Reports of a stowaway found! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
I repeat… Stowaway sighted on board! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
BARRET
Damn, did they find us!?
BARRET
Hmm, I don't think it's us. Did they find TIFA and the others!?
BARRET
Get off your spikey butt and let's go, CLOUD!
Cargo Ship
Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!
TIFA
…But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.
Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.
They take away all the things and people you love…
I wish they'd all disappear. Right, CLOUD?
Yeah…
I don't know
TIFA
You're right!
TIFA
Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir!  Hee hee…
TIFA
…CLOUD. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little.
Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not…
Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!
A seaman's gotta have umph!
I'm tired…
Something's missing
Leave me alone
Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew.
Oh well, seamen never bother with details!
How you feelin'!
I'm tired…
Something's missing
Leave me alone
Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?
I got just the perfect thing! Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink for seamen!!
Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
I'll take it
No thanks
Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor.
This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha !
Thanks! Now let's get on with it!
This is the only real ecstasy you can get on this ship! Ha ha ha!
HP/MP Restored!
Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one!
… …It's me. RED XIII.
RED XIII
I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.
Humans only look at appearances anyway.
Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.
RED XIII
It's pretty hard standing on two feet…
Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.
When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan…
Hey! You don't have enough money!
BARRET
You all right!?
TIFA
Everyone all right!?
AERIS
Huh?
BARRET
Hey, wait.
You don't think that suspicious stowaway is…
TIFA
Everyone's here…right?
Sephiroth!?
TIFA
Really!?
BARRET
How the hell am I supposed to know!?
CLOUD
…Let's find out.
RED XIII
It's the most logical thing to do.  Then, who's going to go?
YUFFIE
N, not me…
I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid…ugh…urk…
CLOUD
… Sephiroth…
…All right, let's go!
BARRET
I'm goin' too!
AERIS
Is it really Sephiroth…?
TIFA
Take me with you!
RED XIII
These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
YUFFIE
I told you…I don't want… to, ugh…urk…

Received "Wind Slash"!
CLOUD
Is it…Sephiroth?
CLOUD
No…not Sephiroth!
…After a long sleep…
…the time…
…time has…come…
BARRET
Look, CLOUD!!
AERIS
Look, CLOUD!!
TIFA
CLOUD, look!!
RED XIII
Over there, CLOUD.
YUFFIE
Ov…over there!!
CLOUD
Sephiroth! You're alive!
Sephiroth
…Who are you?
CLOUD
You don't remember me!? I'm CLOUD!
Sephiroth
CLOUD…
CLOUD
Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
Sephiroth
…The time…is now…
CLOUD
What!? What are you saying!? Be more…
TIFA
I've seen this somewhere…before.
AERIS
I've seen this before…
BARRET
Isn't he…that guy?
RED XIII
That's what disappeared from the Shinra building…
YUFFIE
Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!
CLOUD
…Jenova. The arm of Jenova.
BARRET
Jenova…You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
AERIS
Jenova… With this thing?
TIFA
Jenova… He's been carrying this thing around?
RED XIII
Sephiroth took Jenova… What does it mean?
YUFFIE
Gag… I'm sick enough as it is without you having to show me THAT!
CLOUD
So it WAS Sephiroth.
TIFA
He said something about it being time for something.
AERIS
The time is now… I think that was what was said.
BARRET
He said the time is now.
RED XIII
The time is now? What does that mean?
YUFFIE
He was mumbling something about time!
CLOUD
…Time…is now?
Dock workers--We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. Prepare for docking.
BARRET
I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!
CLOUD, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?
I'll try
No way
AERIS
Hmm… I don't get it.
Hey, CLOUD. Can you explain it to us?
I'll try
Too much trouble
TIFA
I'm getting so confused…
CLOUD, explain what's happened so far.
I'll try
Too much trouble
RED XIII
Hmm… The story's not that simple.
CLOUD, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?
I'll try
Too much trouble
YUFFIE
So what's the story?
Hey CLOUD. Give us a quick run down.
I'll try
Too much trouble
CLOUD
…I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.
CLOUD
Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the Planet… That was 5 years ago.
CLOUD
Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.
CLOUD
And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.
CLOUD
He was carrying Jenova with him.
…This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova.
CLOUD
…I guess that's about it.
CLOUD
Sephiroth… is alive…
The Promised Land… Does it really exist…?
BARRET
Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
AERIS
Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore…
TIFA
We should hide somewhere again.
RED XIII
I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
YUFFIE
Phew… We're finally here… Now we gotta hide.
