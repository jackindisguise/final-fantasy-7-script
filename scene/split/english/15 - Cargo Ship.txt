Cargo Ship
Urrrgh… This is why…I hate ships.
Hey, CLOUD. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?
Here, use this
Nope
Thanks… Gross…this is bitter.
…Unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Ugh, you don't have any?
…Unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Where are the others?
I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?
How should I know…?  Ugh…urk…
…the Engine Room… …a suspicious…character…
No…there's no way… that…not a human… That thing's not human.
…
Hey, get to work!
Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!
If we do good, we could get promoted!
Umm…It's me AERIS.
Hey, CLOUD. Did you see the Airship at Junon?
…I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big.
That was REALLY something.
Hey, do you think I could get on it?
I'll take you someday
I dunno…
…It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.
…Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.
Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.
…Keep hoping.
Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!
Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!
Hey, CLOUD. Did you see BARRET?
I hope he's not doing anything stupid…
It won't do any good trying to stop me!
All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
Geez… What chance for a promotion.
The only one who's gonna benefit from this is the Chief, anyway.
It has nothing to do with us workers.
I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?
The new President's probably the same. He's just gonna order us around anyway.

Look, CLOUD. It's Rufus and Heidegger.
They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em…
Ummmm… Gmmmmm…
How can he… Goin' off laughin' like that?
Because of him, Biggs, Wedge, Jessie…
Ggggggggh… Ggggh… Ggggggghhh!!
God!! I can't take it anymore!
I'm gonna settle things here and now!
Emergency alert! Reports of a stowaway found! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
I repeat… Stowaway sighted on board! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
Damn, did they find us!?
Hmm, I don't think it's us. Did they find TIFA and the others!?
Get off your spikey butt and let's go, CLOUD!
Cargo Ship
Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!
…But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.
Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.
They take away all the things and people you love…
I wish they'd all disappear. Right, CLOUD?
Yeah…
I don't know
You're right!
Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir!  Hee hee…
…CLOUD. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little.
Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not…
Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!
A seaman's gotta have umph!
I'm tired…
Something's missing
Leave me alone
Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew.
Oh well, seamen never bother with details!
How you feelin'!
I'm tired…
Something's missing
Leave me alone
Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?
I got just the perfect thing! Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink for seamen!!
Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
I'll take it
No thanks
Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor.
This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha !
Thanks! Now let's get on with it!
This is the only real ecstasy you can get on this ship! Ha ha ha!
HP/MP Restored!
Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one!
… …It's me. RED XIII.
I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.
Humans only look at appearances anyway.
Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.
It's pretty hard standing on two feet…
Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.
When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan…
Hey! You don't have enough money!
You all right!?
Everyone all right!?
Huh?
Hey, wait.
You don't think that suspicious stowaway is…
Everyone's here…right?
Sephiroth!?
Really!?
How the hell am I supposed to know!?
…Let's find out.
It's the most logical thing to do.  Then, who's going to go?
N, not me…
I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid…ugh…urk…
… Sephiroth…
…All right, let's go!
I'm goin' too!
Is it really Sephiroth…?
Take me with you!
These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
I told you…I don't want… to, ugh…urk…

Received "Wind Slash"!
Is it…Sephiroth?
No…not Sephiroth!
…After a long sleep…
…the time…
…time has…come…
Look, CLOUD!!
Look, CLOUD!!
CLOUD, look!!
Over there, CLOUD.
Ov…over there!!
Sephiroth! You're alive!
Sephiroth
…Who are you?
You don't remember me!? I'm CLOUD!
Sephiroth
CLOUD…
Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
Sephiroth
…The time…is now…
What!? What are you saying!? Be more…
I've seen this somewhere…before.
I've seen this before…
Isn't he…that guy?
That's what disappeared from the Shinra building…
Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!
…Jenova. The arm of Jenova.
Jenova…You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
Jenova… With this thing?
Jenova… He's been carrying this thing around?
Sephiroth took Jenova… What does it mean?
Gag… I'm sick enough as it is without you having to show me THAT!
So it WAS Sephiroth.
He said something about it being time for something.
The time is now… I think that was what was said.
He said the time is now.
The time is now? What does that mean?
He was mumbling something about time!
…Time…is now?
Dock workers--We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. Prepare for docking.
I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!
CLOUD, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?
I'll try
No way
Hmm… I don't get it.
Hey, CLOUD. Can you explain it to us?
I'll try
Too much trouble
I'm getting so confused…
CLOUD, explain what's happened so far.
I'll try
Too much trouble
Hmm… The story's not that simple.
CLOUD, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?
I'll try
Too much trouble
So what's the story?
Hey CLOUD. Give us a quick run down.
I'll try
Too much trouble
…I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.
Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the Planet… That was 5 years ago.
Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.
And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.
He was carrying Jenova with him.
…This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova.
…I guess that's about it.
Sephiroth… is alive…
The Promised Land… Does it really exist…?
Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore…
We should hide somewhere again.
I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
Phew… We're finally here… Now we gotta hide.
