You guys are…
Guess we're safe for now…
Da---mn!
Ohh!
Wha…what is it, what is it?
Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that train!
NO! You damn boneheads!
Did the Shinra beat us!?
What are ya gonna do!? Huge Materia!?
Wha…you're not thinking about giving up…
…shall we go after them?
Hey, do you know who I am?
I'm CID - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey---!
How can they even drive this?
It sure helped having CID here. I had no idea he could drive a train…
Pretty good for an old guy. I'm impressed you can move this thing!
Way to go, Mister! You used to drivin' this thing too?
I'm impressed. You can drive this too?
Don't ask me… I don't know!
What!?
Wa…What!?
What!? For serious!?
Huh?  What'd you just say!?
Wha…what…!?
Don't worry! I can handle this!
Two levers; one on the right and one on the left…
Left lever Right lever
(Directional button up) ([MENU])
I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?
Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.
We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!
All right! We're gonna jump!!
DAMN!
Sorry! I couldn't catch them!
Oh ^%$#&$! We're gonna crash into North Corel!
What the? You…you guys!
All right--- Hand over the Huge Materia!
Whooooa----!
You got guts comin' after me!
I'll never forget you!
No time for that now!
We got it going, but how do we stop it?
Forget the Huge Materia, WE'RE the ones in deep trouble!
What are we gonna do, kill the engineer!?
Hit the brakes, Chief.
I KNOW, already! Just shut up and sit tight! If we keep this up, we'll crash right into North Corel!
Let's see… If we use the levers alternately to accelerate…
Left lever Right lever
(Directional button up) ([MENU])
(Directional button down) ([CANCEL])
It should stop if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!
Hey, it's not working!
We're gaining speed!
Hey-------WAIT! …other way, other way, other way!
Isn't it…the other way?
What are you doin', accelerating!?
^%#@! The other way!? Just watch, I'll…
Hey…HEY HEY!!
WHOOOOOO----A!!
Get serious, you OLD MAN!!
No…DON'T----!!
SH--------!!
Of…of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!
No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like coal!
Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?
The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again…
That's it!
Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fighting' the Shinra?
To you it may be a junk yard, but to us its home.
It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, BARRET!!
Must've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your body.
I already talked to the Inn's owner. Today you can rest for free.
To hell with Meteor! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?
We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor!
You guys are really something!
You sure are brave. I'm impressed!
If you see anything you like, buy it.
Received Key Item "Huge Materia"!
We've lost everything… Now we have to start again from ' 1'…no, from ' 0'.
God, what have we done?
Well, no use just sitting around talking about it. What can we do to get things back to normal?
While you guys were relaxing, Shinra troops took the Huge Materia.
The train's crashing in
Thank you, God, the train stopped.
It didn't do any damage.”
I heard that kid found something that glows.
My store was all right!
I have a tool shop, but I don't have any tools to fix my store…
Yay! My house is finished!!
Um… where was the next train station?
^$#@%$ ! We couldn't stop the train…
We have to do something about Shinra! Sick of hearin' about sad things like this!
I did it again… I can't keep up with this.
I could never forgive Shinra!
I'd be sad if this place was my hometown…
We got into this situation because we goofed…
A spectacular sight…
I got a glowing rock from the well.
I'll sell it to you for 50000 gil!
You don't have enough money! Don't try to take advantage of me just because I'm a kid!!
I wish someone would buy this rock off of me…
Huh? You have lots of 'em!
You can't carry all of 'em. So I'm gonna keep it in my pocket…
It's Huge Materia that the Shinra's after… The only one left is in the underwater reactor in Junon.
We gotta get there first and protect it!!
We must get there first and stop them.
We got to get there first and stop them…
We've got to get there first and stop them.
Yeah, but since we got in their way the last time, they should've gotten a little more cautious.
I doubt they'll fly right into action. I'm more concerned about him than anything else.
CLOUD, it's you.
Yes, it's you CLOUD.
It is you CLOUD.
Yeah, and I'm worried that even TIFA's gonna fall over on her butt.
Let's go back and see what's happening… to Mideel…
Th, that light just now… The Condor… The egg…
What!? Would you go outside and see what it was?
Would you go check on it immediately?
Gone…
Oh, it's you. Thanks a lot.
Be sure and report to my father, too.
Oh, yeah. I found this just now on the battlefield. Maybe it'll come in handy for you guys.
Received "Magic Comb"!
Received "Peace Ring"!
Received "Super Ball"!
Received three "Tincture"!
Received five "Potion"!
Received three "Turbo Ether"!
Received three "Elixir"!
Received three "Elixir"!
top of the mountain
Received "Phoenix" Materia!
Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks.
Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure you can stop in and stay any time. So be sure to drop by.
Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you…
What is this?
Damn man, it's Huge Materia.
This Materia is really out-of-this-world!
Wow, it's something!
Huh? What's this?
Gotta have that Materia!
Hmm, you mean this?
The truth is, this is the Materia inside the reactor.
Then you're telling me we protected a reactor that didn't have any Materia inside?
If that's the case, then you should have told us. There may have been another way to fight Shinra.
What the hell did we fight for?
We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the Condor.
When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how we knew what was inside the reactor.
I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked in and took the Materia.
I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. I'm really sorry.
Well… Maybe it was for the best.
Besides, there was no guarantee we'd defeat Shinra.
No, I think what happened is good. Cause we didn't know if we'd win.
Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.
I see. If you put it that way… we're really grateful.
We gotta get there and stop 'em…
Getting to the reactor before them…
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout TIFA. She may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.
How 'bout checkin' in on 'em? Down to Mideel!
