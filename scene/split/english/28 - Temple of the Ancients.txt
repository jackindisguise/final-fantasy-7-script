Temple of the Ancients
This is…the Temple of the Ancients…
I…I know… I feel it… The knowledge of the Ancients…floating…
You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it with the strength of will.
For the future? For us?
What are you saying? Do you understand?
You're uneasy… But happy?
Because I'm here? I'm sorry…I don't understand.
I want to go inside!
Black cape
Key…stone…
Open…door…of the Temple…
Black…Materia…
Look…
Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
It says number 9. He has a tattoo on his neck.
He's number 9. There's a tattoo.
Oh!? It's a number 9 tattoo.
He has a tattoo too! Ummm, I think it's number 9.
Hey, he's got a tattoo. It says number 9.
It's a number 9 tattoo.
CAIT SITH…
Hey! It's Tseng!
Tseng? Of the Turks!?
Oh, I've been tricked.
It's not the Promised Land… Sephiroth's searching for…
Sephiroth? He's inside!?
Look… for yourself…
Damn…
Letting AERIS go was the start… of my…bad luck…
The President… was wrong…
You're wrong.
The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.
And, I'm not going to help.
Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won.
…Pretty harsh. Sounds like something… you'd say.
The Keystone… Place it…on…the altar…
Received Key Item "Keystone"!
You crying?
…Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since we were little…
There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me.
I am…still alive…
Let's put the Keystone in.
Damn! So this is the Temple of the Ancients!
Oh man, you gotta be kiddin'. This is makin' me dizzy!
Hey, CLOUD! Don't get lost!
Words…feelings… So many of them here.
Geeeez! We got our work cut out for us.
This is starting to get me really dizzy…
@#$%! @#$%! @#$%! What the hell's with this place!
Wow, this place is huge! I'm starting to get bored.
No exits… We can't turn back.
…sniff…sniff… This place smells good.
It smells the same as Cosmo Canyon.
What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?
…CLOUD! I know it's going to be tough, but…
Don't give up! We can do it!
Sealed……? That sound brings back memories.
Received "Morph" Materia!
Received "Luck Plus" Materia!
Received "Trident"!
Received "Rocket Punch"!
Received "Ribbon"!
Temple of the Ancients
Nyum…nyum…
Can I buy something?
Let me rest
I want to save my game
Nothing
This is the Temple of the Ancients. You won't be able to go back easily.
Is that all right?
Save
Welcome!
Please come again!
HP/MP Restored!
Whew! We finally caught up to you.
I'm sorry. You waited for me.
Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.
They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.
Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.
Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.
Please, talk to me!
No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid?
Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?
Received "Mop"!
Received "Silver Rifle"!
…phew… We did it!
Everyone all right? That was rough.
Oh no…CLOUD. Come quick!!
Hurry, this way!
It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.
No…not knowledge …consciousness…a living soul…
It's trying to say something.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
What?
…Danger? An evil…consciousness?
…show? You're going to show me?
Temple of the Ancients
What's going on?
Wait! Look! It's showing us!
Test Play is up to here.
Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?
…I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.
Be careful, Tseng.
Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?
Th…Thank you very much.
If I may be excused…
Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be…
Sephiroth!!
So you opened the door. Well done.
This place…what is it?
A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients….
I am becoming one with the Planet.
One with the Planet?
You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.
All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom…knowledge…
I will meld with it all. I will become one with it… it will become one with me.
…You can do that?
The way…lies here.
Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.
For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, you will live again as a part of me.
Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw it.
…I saw it.
I…I saw it.
…I saw it. Tseng was in bad shape.
Oh grossness!
An illusion the Ancients showed.
Hey hey! Wh, what's the catch?
…Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?
Almost there…
Sephiroth is here, right?
No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here.
I'm taking him out!
You mean WE are, right?
We're here too, you know.
Don't forget about us!
I wonder if he'll go down that easy?
I have nothing to do with it. But, I guess I'll lend a hand.
All right! Guess you youngsters gotta be enthusiastic like that!
Save
I am the Time Guardian. Ye who seek the knowledge of the Ancients. I control the time, select your path.
What is it you wish, seeker of knowledge?
Speed up time
Go back in time
How fast would ye move time?
Just a bit
A little more
Plenty

…It is time… You may proceed.
[MENU]: Leave it up to the Guard
[OK]: Spin
[CANCEL]: Proceed now!
[OK]: Stop!
[MENU]: Move it myself
[MENU]: Go back in time

This atmosphere…
Feels like a battle!
Here it comes!
It's a battle!
A battle…
Oh man! I should've stayed at home.
I'm tingling with excitement.
Let's do it!
Received "Nail Bat"!
Received "Princess Guard"!
Received "Trumpet Shell"!
Received "Megalixir"!
Hey! It's locked.
No good. We have to catch it!
You must be tired.
I want to go home
Just hang in there. Someday we'll look back on these hard times and laugh.
Yeah. But it'll all be over soon!
Received "Work Glove"!
Door Unlocked!!
The Guard that escaped with the key to the door moves on a set course.
Memorize the doors he enters and exits to figure out the pattern and catch him at an exit.
Oh yeah, oh yeah… you can jump down to the ramp below and to the left of the screen.
It probably won't hurt if I jump from here...
Jump
Jump to the lower level with [OK]!
This is the room with the murals…
Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
So cold.
I am always by your side.
Come.
Splendid.
A treasure house of knowledge…
I don't understand what you're saying!
Look well.
At what!?
At that which adds to the knowledge of…
…Mother… …it's almost time.
Hey!! CLOUD!!
Hey, CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD! What are you doing?
CLOUD! What's going on with you?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing?
Ha ha ha… Black Materia
CLOUD!! Get a hold of yourself!
I… CLOUD…
Is this Meteor?
Looks like we're locked in.
Soon… we will become one.
How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
It's simple.
Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury.
The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury.
…What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet?
Think how much energy would be gathered!
Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me.
All that boundless energy will be mine.
By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence.
Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now…
Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?
Injure…the Planet?
Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic…Meteor.
That'll never happen!
Wake up!!
Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
CLOUD! What's wrong!
Ha ha ha… Call Meteor.
How should I?
…I remember! I remember my way.
Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?
…It's nothing so don't worry about it.
It's nothing.”
Sephiroth got away.
…Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.
So this must be Meteor, right?
Is it some sort of a disaster?
It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
Is something going to fall from the sky?
Something's going to fall down?
Oh, so something's going to fall from the sky?  It's going to be something big.
Something huge is falling from the sky?
I don't know what it is but…
It looks like it's going to make a mess…
I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?
Hmpf! It's not even an omen.
…This must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.
The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.
It finds small drifting planets with its magic.
And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely…
Sephiroth!?
Ha ha ha… It is not me.
During the time when the Ancients prospered there existed beings that grew up bathed in abundant Mako.
They were pure creatures of natural shape. Several remain even now.
These beings sealed their consciousness within materia, altering their lives for eternity.
The summon materia…
Correct. Such a clever girl.
The creatures that protect this temple have lived long, relics from the age of the Ancients.
They belong to this planet even more than you do.
Heh heh heh… Keep that in mind.
Any sign of Sephiroth?
He disappeared.
Received "Bahamut" Materia!
What is this?
…There's something written on it.
B.l.a.c.k…M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
Black Materia!!
…Black Materia.
What should we do, CLOUD?
Shake it
Take it
Leave it
Wait a minute. I'll ask!
I don't understand…
Really!?
They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.
If we could only move this, we could take the Black Materia.
But, the Temple would collapse.
Then just leave it.
If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?
Let's just leave it, OK?
That'll be safer. If no one else can take it…
Then Sephiroth can't either, right?
The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it.
I guess that means it's safe here.
Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!
Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?
No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.
Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.
It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia.
This place isn't safe.
So what are we going to do?
I heard your situation!
Hi, CLOUD. This is CAIT SITH.
Don't forget about me.
Everything you said makes perfect sense!
You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia. And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
So that means you don't trust me?
But CLOUD. There's really nothing else you can do.
Everyone, please trust me.
I guess we have no choice
No way
All righty then! Leave it all to me!
You sure are stubborn, CLOUD.
Everyone, hurry up and get outside!
I'll go with you to a safe place.
Please hurry, you've got to get out of here!
I'll be waiting at the exit!
Please believe me, CLOUD.
Hmmm, I guess I have to
How can I?
This must be it!
The Ancients sure did a great job making this.
I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed…
There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's only one me!
Don't forget me even if another CAIT SITH comes along.
Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet…
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?
Then no one could take it.
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.
And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.
As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too. Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?
Yes, but there's one thing…
You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.
So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
I see… the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily…
I guess there's no way we can open it… We'll come back later.
It's warm…
This isn't good…
CLOUD… …behind you.
Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's Me!!
I'll handle the rest!
Well, everyone… Take care of yourselves!
Come on, CLOUD… Say something.
I'm not good at this.
Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.
Why don't you read our fortunes?
Say, that's right… I haven't done it in a while, huh?
I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me
Now, what should I predict?
Hmm, let's see how compatible CLOUD and I are!
That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!
Here I go!
This isn't good. I can't say it.
Poor TIFA.
No! Tell me!
I promise I won't get mad!
Is that so? Then I'll tell you.
Looks good. You are perfect for each other!
AERIS's star and CLOUD's star! They show a great future!
CLOUD, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher… I'll do whatever you want me to!
You just call me when it all happens!
Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.
This is the final, final farewell!
Be strong CAIT SITH!!
She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.
Owwww…
What happened?
I can still move more.
That's the Black Materia…
Hey! I'll keep watch here!
I'll wait here.
I'll be sittin' out here.
Heh heh…this looks majorly boring, so I'll stay here.
I'm gonna have a smoke out here!
Ahhh!! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this.
I'll be looking around here.
Got Key Item "Black Materia!"
As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.
Can you guys use it?
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.
You mean lots of spiritual energy?
That's right.
One person's power alone won't do it.
Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy…
The Promised Land!!
The Promised Land!!
No, but…
Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.
…Ah, but I have.
I'm far superior to the Ancients.
I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients.
I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients.
And soon, I will create the future.
I won't let you do it! The future is not just yours!
Ha, ha, ha…I wonder?
Wake up!
Sh…shut up!
The…noise…
No!
Don't be afraid--!
Waaaa~!!
What are you doing!?
There, CLOUD…good boy.
Wa…aaaa…aaa…
Gave "Black Materia" to Sephiroth!
…Well done.
CLOUD, are you all right?
…I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth?
Wha…what did I do? Tell me, AERIS.
CLOUD…be strong, OK?
Urrrrrrgh… What have I done!?
CLOUD… you haven't done anything.
It's not your fault.
I…I'm---!
CLOUD!!
CLOUD, what are you doing!?
Urrggggggh!!!! CLOUD!!
HEY! CLOUD, you #$#&@!
CLOUD!!
AERIS, are you all right!?
What!? CLOUD!
AERIS! CLOUD, what're you doing!?
…!!
Hey, EY!!
CLOUD! What the hell are you doing!?
Oops! This looks like a bad time!
I'm CAIT SITH No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all!
I'm CAIT SITH No. 2. Pleased to meet you all!
CLOUD!! What are you doin'!!
Everything is white…
What did I do? I don't remember anything…
My memory…since when? If everything's a dream, don't wake me.
I'm far superior to the Ancients.
CLOUD… you haven't done anything.
Oops! This looks like a bad time!
I'm CAIT SITH No. 2. Pleased to meet you all!
I'm CAIT SITH No. 2. Pleased to meet you all!
CLOUD!! What are you doin'!!
CLOUD, can you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened.
Don't worry about it.
…I can't help it…
Oh…
Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?
And let me handle Sephiroth.
And CLOUD, you take care of yourself.
So you don't have a breakdown, okay?
What is this place?
This forest leads to the City of the Ancients… and is called the Sleeping Forest.
It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.
That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.
The secret is just up here.
At least it should be. …I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.
Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over.
AERIS?
Hmm… So she's going to interfere? She'll be a difficult one, don't you think?
We must stop that girl soon.
[Empty Entry]
[Empty Entry]
You look like you was havin' a nightmare.
How are you feeling?
I seem to be OK
Not good
Don't really know
That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
Oh… Better keep it to yourself.
I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.
You know, CLOUD. AERIS is gone.
Everyone's out looking for AERIS.
…The City of the Ancients. AERIS is headed there.
By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?
Hey, we're goin' too.
Only the Ancients, only AERIS can save us from Meteor…
Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to AERIS? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
Sephiroth…already knows.
Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
No.
I might lose it again.
If Sephiroth comes near me I might…
Yeah, godammit! It's because of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
My fault?
I know you got problems… Hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.
But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
CLOUD, we came this far… Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
Goddamn jackass, that's what you are…
Just think about it… How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?
People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.
But, they go on living. They don't run away… That's just how it is.
CLOUD…you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
No…
I'm afraid. If this keeps up, I may go crazy!
I'm afraid…
What…am I supposed to do?
Just pull out of here?
To where?
Wait a minute, TIFA. give him a little time.
He has to decide this on his own.
You believe in CLOUD… right?
You awake?
Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.
You sure do have good friends.
Hey, how are you?
I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?
You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?
Either way, if you stay around here all you're gonna do is worry about it.
Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth… If it happens, it happens.
I'll go upside your spikey head and bring you back to normal!
CLOUD, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
But…
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
…You're…right. He's right, isn't he?
Come on, let's go and find AERIS.
…I'm afraid to find out the truth. But…why?
