What took you so long, CLOUD?
Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take the Tiny Bronco east towards the sea, we should be able to find it.
Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?
I want to go! I'm going for sure!
Then see you later.
Yo! I'm goin' too, CLOUD! Gotta keep movin'!!
The Temple of the Ancients is to the east. Shall we go?
You know…no, forget it. Let's go.
I'm startin' to get nervous.
I don't care what's goin' on. Let's just go!
The Temple of the Ancients… This might be pretty interesting…
I'm so excited, my tail's starting to tingle. Let's go, CLOUD!
