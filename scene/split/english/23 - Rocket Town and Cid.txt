Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge of it.
Captain?
Did you see a man in a black cape?
The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program.
He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident…
Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space.
A man in a black cape? Nope…never seen him.
This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets.
You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never got off the ground though.
Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were planning to launch the rocket.
Rocket launch plan? What do you mean?
You don't know?
There was a plan to send a man into outer space. It was headed up by the leader of the Shinra Space Program, Palmer.
This town is the result of the plan, but the plan got cut…
Who's the 'Captain'?
Did you see a man in a black cape?
Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's representative, so you should really talk with him.
Welcome to the Shanghai Inn!
It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?
Yes
No
Yes sir. Thank you!
Well then, come by again sometime.
Excuse me. Please don't come in here. Our books and the room keys are in here, so I'll have to ask you to please stay out.
The books… Maybe we could find out who's been here?
Was there a man in a black cape?
Not interested
Look, we're all adults here, so I'd appreciate it if you used some discretion.
A man with a black cape? No, no one like that has ever stayed here.
Would you like something to drink?
Let me hear your story
Not interested
CID's had some bad breaks. It's really no one's fault he couldn't go into space.
Just bad luck, I guess…
If he keeps up like that, he's gonna collapse someday. Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack.
…That's too bad. Please come again.
A drink will ease your heart…
Welcome! This is the Item Shop.
…Hey now! I would appreciate it if you wouldn't come in.
What's that?
A rusty old rocket… Wonder why they made something so huge?
That rusted out rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space Program.
It just looms there. That's how the town got its name… Shinra No. 26'.
Want to look at the rocket with me?
Yeah, let's take a look
No, not interested
I get so impressed every time I look at it.
Oh, how boring…
All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long.
Well, he really loves machinery…
Locked
Excuse me… You don't have enough money.
Let me handle all your weapon and accessory needs!
There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket…
Is my rocket…all right?
The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? But why now?
…I'm in here.
Urrrrgh, urrrgh
P… Urrrrgh…aaaaaghh…
There's a lot happenin' in the world outside, but as long as I got this rocket I'm satisfied.
Anyways.
How 'bout it? Want to look at the rocket with me?
Look up
No
My, my precious rocket… It's gone.
Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone.
But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will.
What's young President Rufus doing by getting all those mechanics together?
Guard
Those terrorists are here!
Guard Captain
Don't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!
Oh, I'm getting excited.
Mmm, a SPECTACLE.
Guard Captain
Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere!" Uh un, nowhere!
Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my rocket!?
I'm outta here, CLOUD! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right out of my rocket!
Wait, CLOUD!
If you're gonna kick those *#$% Shinra out of my rocket, then take me with you!
ALL RIGHT! Let's show those &$!@& Shinra!
CLOUD, what are you doin'!? They're gonna launch the rocket!!
Rude
You again?
Rude
We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way.
Rude
…They got us.
Rude
…Hmm.
What? You guys are terrorists? Wow, that's kinda exciting!
Mmm, here comes some hard action!
Hmm. Is it real or fake?
I'm so curious I can't sleep.
Mmm… I'm starting to see it now… Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.
But, out of appreciation, let me give you this.
I wish you'd take care of it and use it…
Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby…
Oh, it's you? I heard you and the Captain really made a BANG!
I also heard that Rufus was so pissed off he went on a rampage and that no one's been able to get near him!
If things go on like this, then Meteor's just going to smash right into us and kill us all, right? …I guess that's life?
I get so restless with the rocket gone. And now that we can see Meteor clearly, …I can't stand it.
I heard Tiny Bronco broke…
That sucks. I was secretly eyeing that thing. Broke, huh? What a drag.
Look up at the sky. The bigger Meteor gets, the less time we have to live.
I still can't believe that piece of crap rocket actually made it into space…
I guess the mechanic was a genius.
Because those Shinra creeps locked us up in our houses, we couldn't even watch the rocket lift off.
I never thought that my only hobby would be destroyed by that arrogant young Rufus!
Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at CID's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing…
Welcome to the Shanghai Inn! Only 300 gil a night?
Yes
No
Y'know, I heard Rufus rushed back to headquarters in Midgar…
Even though they failed to blow up Meteor with the rocket, the Shinra haven't given up yet…
Looks like they're gathering all the weapons from all their bases and are preparing for a final showdown.
I heard a rumor that a Shinra airship carrying a secret weapon was attacked by a monster and sunk to the bottom of the sea…
You don't feel comfortable here? Then, everytime you look in the sky you see Meteor.
How long's that guy gonna be in the bathroom? I need to go, too…
Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore the rocket…
Meteor's coming toward us!? And I can't even go to the bathroom…!?
OK, which is gonna happen first? Meteor hits us, or that guy comes out of the bathroom?
I'm not movin' from this spot till I see it with my own eyes.
Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?
Is Gramps gonna stay like that even though rocket's gone?
Geeeeez, it's boring! Isn't anything exciting going to happen here?
Now that one of Shinra's greatest events is over, I guess it's back to the same old boring life again…
Mmm, I'm so bored. Isn't there anything that can excite me?
Even the rocket launch wasn't all THAT great.
Shera
I'll take care of everything at home. But please take care of the Captain.
Shera
What's going to happen?
Shera
Now all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able…
Excuse me… …Please take care of the Captain.
There're tons of what look
like antique guns.
…I bet the owner of this store
was a real gun fanatic.
A gun is a MAN'S weapon! Nuthin' else'll do!
Hmm, let's see… do I know any good jokes?
It's my job to make people laugh all over the world…
Hey CID! I just thought of the best joke! Listen to this one.
I'm so sick of hearing these dumb puns, but okay…let's get it over with. Go on…let me hear it.
Uh, now, let's see, how did it go?
…'He's crude an' a jerk'… I mean, He's 'Rude of the Turks'!
'President Rufus, lathers Tantrics'… Uh, I mean… President Rufus, gathers mechanics'…
'Raunchy meat, a pocket full, at the cafeteria'. Uh, I mean… Launch a beat up rocket full of Materia'.
And I thought it might be fun to hear some of your stupid puns again for old times sake… my mistake.
Oh, 'crap-again'(oh, captain).
Dammit! That does it!
How rude…
Rude, hell! You're the one who always cracks those #$##@& jokes!
Sorry, 'bout that, now lesse…
Looks like that *&%$#^$ Rufus wants to use my rocket for somethin'.
Let's go to the launching pad!
(A fearful sense of humor…)
(A fearful sense of humor…)
…??
Ugh… Nice kick.
I got to learn more… Devotion, devotion.
DAMMIT! No more of them ^$#%$@# puns!
And?
(The problem starts way before his sense of humor.)
Would you like a drink?
Let's hear your story
No thanks
Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from Corel and Fort Condor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.
I can't stand the thought of them using my rocket for something like this.
Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.
I can't stand them using my precious rocket for a thing like this.
Authorized personnel only.
Shera
Excuse me…CLOUD?
Shera
Did the Captain say anything?
Nope…
Shera
Welcome home.
^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?
We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!
Shera
I…I'm sorry.
Really, don't mind us.
Shut up! Sit your butts down in those chairs and drink your goddamn TEA!
Arggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!
…Damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?
Sheesh!! What bad manners!
Poor Shera.
Who does he think he is?
Man, this sucks!
Man, he sure seems wound up tight.
…
Sorry. It's our fault.
Shera
No, no. He's always like this.
Shera
Oh?
Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco!
An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?
He always like this? That's pretty bad!
Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?
Is it always like this?
Why is CID so hard on you?
I think it's a bit too harsh.
Is he like this all the time? Bitin' your head off like that? I could never stand it…
What's his prob!? I'm gonna go clean that guy's clock!!
…It's amazing that you can live with it.
Shera
No… It's because of my stupid mistake.
I was the one who destroyed his dream…
What happened?
Shera
He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the mission, to save my life.
After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was canceled.
It's my fault his dream was destroyed…
Shera
That's why…it's all right. I don't care what the Captain says, I'll live my life for him.
Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!
Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for you!?
They're late… Where is Rufus?
Palmer
Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So CID, how ya been?
Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on keepin' me waitin'!?
Palmer
Hey-hey!  I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you ask him?
^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!
Palmer
Don't say 'fat'!
Palmer
Hey-hey! Tea!
Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and… oh yeah, don't forget the lard!
Palmer
Hey-hey? Have we met before?
So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?
Shera
Is President Rufus here to announce that he's going to restart the Space Program?
Palmer
Hey-hey! Is the tea ready yet?
With plenty of sugar and honey. Oh yeah, and don't forget the lard, too.
What the!? You got me all excited for nothing!?
Then, what'd you come here for?
Rufus
I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco.
&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco.
Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?
Rufus
Oh my…
You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were able to fly in the first place.
What!?
Shera
Uh, excuse me…
Shera
This way…
Shera
You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?
Shera
I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?
Rufus
We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction.
But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane…
What're you guys doin' here?
We heard the Captain was here.
Captain? I'm the Captain!
The name's CID. Everyone calls me 'Captain', though.
What d'ya want?
Tell me about this rocket
Is Rufus coming?
Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"?
Wow! Not bad for a kid.
Alright then, I'll explain it to you.
You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right?
Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer.
Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine.
There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger.
They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26.
They chose the best pilot in Shinra… no, in the world--me. I mean, come on.
And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well…
But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. That's why they became so anal!
And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans.
After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got my damn hopes up…DAMN THEM!
Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration.
Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for them!
Look at this rusted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man in space with this.
Everyday, it tilts a little bit more.
At this rate, I don't know which'll be first, this thing falling over or me gettin' outta here.
Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program.
A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, too!
You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.
Ummm… Just look around.
My last hope is to talk to the President.
Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!
Even the moon'd get tired waitin' around for your ass!
Shera
I'm…I'm sorry.
Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!
Shera, bein' careful's good, but no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank, it won't matter.
That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over.
Shera
But…
No buts!!
You're not stupid, so be more efficient!
Shera
I'm sorry…
Instrument panel…all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch.
Control
Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. Beginning countdown.
…Finally.
What the? What happened!?
Control
CID! We have an emergency situation!
A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?
Control
I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Hey goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?
Shera
It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch.
Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?
Shera
I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test weren't satisfactory.
You stupid little $#^%!
It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be #$!% left when we blast off!
You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know that, doncha!?
Shera
I don't mind.
If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done.
Almost done!? You're gonna die!
Control
CID, We must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!
Control
What are you going to do, CID? If we cancel now, it'll be another six months until the next launch!
Control
Starting engine!
GODDAMMIT, Shera… you wanna make me a murderer?
Shera
Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, it's all clear.
Oh man, the moon…outer space… my dreams…
Control
Ignite Engine!
Control
15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising.
SH-------#%!!
Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!
We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26.
All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!
Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!
We're praying for your safety!
Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!
Thanks, guys!
Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!
Shera
Captain!
Shera!?
Control
30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown.
Control
CID! Forget about her. We won't make it in time!
Come on, Shera…hurry up… You're gonna die…
What…what am I… What am I supposed to do?
There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco… This is cool.
Shinra always keeps the best things for themselves. Let's take it!
I wonder if we can borrow it…
Let's take it, OK CLOUD?
Will it fly? Is it all right to just take it?
CLOUD! If we steal it, we'll get in deep trouble!
…Want me to keep watch?
CLOUD, let's steal it! I love stealing from the Shinra!
Um…may I help you?
No… We're just looking at it.
…If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The Captain should be in the rocket.
I'm Shera. And what are your names?
I'm CLOUD.
I'm BARRET, of AVALANCHE.
TIFA. Nice to meet you.
I'm AERIS.
Nanaki, otherwise known as RED XIII.
Fortune telling machine CAIT SITH, here.
VINCENT. I am…nevermind.
I'm YUFFIE!
Shera
Hmm… So you're not with the Shinra?
I thought you were bringing approval for the Space Program.
…!?
Shera
President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so restless all morning.
Rufus!!?
Palmer
Hmm… Why do I have to do this…? I'm the head of the Space Program…
Palmer
I've seen you somewhere before…
Palmer
I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp!
We'll be taking the Tiny Bronco.
Palmer
Se…se…security!!
I can't stop it!
I can't stop it!
I can't stop it!
It's taking off.
No! It's taking off!
No!! It's gonna take off!
I can't stop…
Forget it! Get in!!
All right, here we go!
Gimme that!
I want to try it!
I wanna try!
Leave it to me.
Let me handle it.
Let me be the pilot!
I'll do it.
CID! Get on!
Godammit! What are you amateurs doing!
Rufus
CLOUD!? Don't let 'em get away! Shoot 'em down!
%#^@!! The tail's been hit!
Emergency landing…
This's gonna be a big splash. Hold on to your drawers and don't piss in 'em!
She won't fly anymore.
Can't we use it as a boat?
$#&%! Do whatever you want!
CID, what will you do now?
I dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on that town.
How about your wife? Shera?
Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her gives me the chills.
What're you guys gonna do?
We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get Rufus of the Shinra someday too.
I don't know about any of that, but…
What the hell!? Sign me up!
How 'bout it, everyone?
I don't care.
Of course, no problem!
I'm all for it.
I don't really care.
I don't mind.
Whatever!
…Do whatever you like.
Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!
Numbskulls…?
Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has GOTTA be a numbskull! I like it!
So, where we headed?
Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth to the Temple of the Ancients.
Really!?…Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?
Dunno. That numbskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'… so maybe it's off this way?
Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the Ancients… that name bothers me.
…Hm. How 'bout goin' west?
No, no reason. NO reason at all!
