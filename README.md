# About This Project:
I started this project because Final Fantasy VII is one of my favorite stories of all time, and I want to be able to read it in its entirety in Japanese.
I also want to share the information with others so they can also read Final Fantasy VII in its original language for themselves.

This project is only possible due to the script files compiled by ***Jason Maltz***.
