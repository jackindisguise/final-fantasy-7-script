The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?
Where's AERIS?
…
AERIS? How did you know that name? You must be…
AERIS, you mean that kid. The receptionist? I was startin' to worry about her, too.
And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?
You mean, she's not? It's someone else?
Oh, I see. So you must be that whatcha call it…
Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!
You know, this building looks like it's starting to fall apart.
This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right away.
Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors, too. Here, take this.
Received Key Item "Keycard 62"!
This door is stuck wide open. Better fix this right away.
This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for the company big wigs.
It's tough working under someone. It wears you out.
I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know what that was all about?
No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th floor is safe.
What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?
Even employees can't access floors above the 60th without a keycard.
I don't remember seeing your face before… You new here?
Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some…things.
Things?
Um, I'm kinda in a hurry…
Oh? That's too bad…
Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach you how to get to the next floor.
The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th floor. But you can't get there without a keycard.
Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely.
…voila! Hear that sound and the door will open.
Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard alone won't let you go everywhere.
For example,
'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. Keycard 65' only takes you to the 65th floor.
It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, they control everything in Midgar and in the world for that matter.
Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!

How do you do?
This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office.
I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me…
Domino
Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?
You all must be those…ahem… Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of Midgar.
Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc.
My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents…
Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh…
You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard.
Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard!
Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!
Domino
Got it? Then tell me.
So, what's the password?
BEST
KING
ORBS
BOMB
MAKO
HOJO
Wait a second
Domino
Nope! You're ALL wrong! It's a much better word than that! Try again!
Domino
BEST!!
God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best…ME!! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Domino
KING!!
God, I love the sound of that! KING!! President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Domino
BOMB!!
God, I love the sound of that! BOMB!! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode!
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Domino
MAKO!!
God, I love the sound of that! MAKO! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor!
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Received "Keycard 65"!
Domino
Why would I do something like this, you ask?
Revenge, of course!
Shinra's been torturing me forever.
That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer.
This ought to teach them! Heh heh heh…
Domino
But my card will only get you to the 65th floor.
Can you believe how they treat me? …ME! Like some common employee…
Hart
Did you speak with the Mayor?
What? A password? Oh, I get it…
He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.
Maybe I can help you.
What do you want to know?
The password…duh!
How about a hint?
Get out of my face
Hart
…I see. Then, I guess that's that.
Good luck finding it on your own.
If you decide you want help. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime…
What can I do for you?
Give me the hint again
Give me the next hint
Uh, nothing
Hart
Sure, sure. All right.
As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.
So here's a hint…
…for 500 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 1000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 2000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 5000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 15000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
Hart
What do you want to know?
HELP
Forget it
Hart
Hey now! You're a bit short.
No one works on credit nowadays… not even stores in the slums.
Hart
I can't believe it! I gave you all these hints, and you STILL don't get it?
You guys are amazing! Really, amazing…
Well, seeing as things have come to this, I might as well just tell you.
Hart
Oh, my…well, Thank you very much.
Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc….
Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries.
Pay careful attention to the files in each room.
The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.
Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library.
Look carefully at the numbers on each file.
There is a number at the beginning of each file name.
Look at the number on the files that don't belong in that library. Match the number with the letters in the title of the file.
If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and… well, you get the idea.
Hart
What do you mean the next hint? I've practically told you, didn't I?
…all right. Since this seems like a special case, I'll give you MY key card!
Hart
If you run into President Shinra, please don't tell him about this.
I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.
Domino
I never thought you'd get it on the first try…
Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, a promise is a promise. Take this, too.
Received "Elemental" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia.

Domino
Hmm. It appears you're not completely stupid.
Fine then, take this.
Domino
I see… For you…this might be best.
Then, this is for all of you.
Domino
Hoo boy! You finally got it?
You all really don't use your heads much, do you?
……What the hey. Here, just take it anyway.

When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be complete.
That must be why he took
Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some sort of stench coming from somewhere…
It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands.
Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files…
But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of being a secretary!
Come on, we're building the future of Mako!
…………………… …………………… …………………… …………………… …………………… …………………… Phew!
BARRET
Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
Reeve
We have the damage estimates for Sector 7.
Considering those factories we already set up and all the investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil…
Reeve
The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is…
President Shinra
We're not rebuilding.
Reeve
What?
President Shinra
We're leaving Sector 7 as it is.
And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.
Reeve
…then the Ancients?
President Shinra
The Promised Land will soon be ours.
President Shinra
I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.
Palmer
Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space Program in the budget!
President Shinra
Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate increase.
Palmer
Oh man!
Reeve
Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence…
President Shinra
It'll be all right.
The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more.
Heidegger
Ha ha ha!
After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!
BARRET
That dirty #$*$^
President Shinra
Hojo. How's the girl?
Hojo
As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18 %.
President Shinra
How long will the research take?
Hojo
Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.
Hojo
That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.
President Shinra
What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?
Hojo
That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong… and yet has her weaknesses.
CLOUD
They were talking about AERIS…right?
BARRET
I dunno.
TIFA
Probably.
CLOUD
Let's follow 'em.
Scarlet
Something stinks…
President Shinra
That concludes our meeting.
Flush?
Climb up?
Get out of here
CLOUD
Hojo…huh…?
BARRET
I remember him.
BARRET
That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. CLOUD, don't you know him?
CLOUD
This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So…that's what he looks like…
Is this today's specimen?
Hojo
Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
Hojo
My precious specimen…
TIFA
Precious specimen…?
TIFA
Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
CLOUD
Jenova…
CLOUD
Jenova… Sephiroth's… So…they've brought it here.
TIFA
CLOUD, be strong!
CLOUD
Did you see it?
BARRET
See what?
CLOUD
It's moving……still alive?
BARRET
Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.
Let's see… The specimen Hojo asked me for is…
That elevator back there is only to transport Specimens. You can't use it. It would be a lot easier if it led to the 68 Floor Research Lab.
Hojo
AERIS? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?
CLOUD
We're taking AERIS back.
Hojo
Outsiders……
BARRET
Shoulda noticed it earlier, you…
Hojo
There's so many frivolous things in this world.
Hojo
Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.
The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?
CLOUD
Ugh.
Hojo
That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.
Hojo
Now, bring in the Specimen!
CLOUD
What do you think you're doin'?
Hojo
Lending a helping hand to an endangered species… Both of them are on the brink of extinction…
Hojo
If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.
TIFA
…animal? That's terrible! AERIS is a human being!
BARRET
You're gonna pay!
AERIS
CLOUD, help!
CLOUD
BARRET! Can't you do anything?
BARRET
Awright!! Step back!
Hojo
Stop!!
Hojo
Wh…what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens…
Hojo
Take care of the rest!
Hojo
This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
CLOUD
Now's our chance to get AERIS!
AERIS
Thanks, CLOUD.
TIFA
CLOUD…what's wrong?
CLOUD
…The elevator is moving.
BARRET
Oh shit… We're surrounded.
He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.
TIFA
It talked!?
I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss.
CLOUD
We'll take care of that monster.
Somebody take AERIS somewhere safe…
TIFA, I'm countin' on you!
BARRET, take care of her!
CLOUD
What's your name?
RED XIII
Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish.
CLOUD
Come on!
CLOUD
AERIS, you all right?
TIFA
She seems all right, …in many ways.
RED XIII
I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things.
BARRET
What are you?
RED XIII
An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see.
RED XIII
…You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way.
AERIS
CLOUD… so you did come for me.
RED XIII
I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard……
BARRET
Now we've saved AERIS, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So let's get the hell outta here!
CLOUD
If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up in two groups.
AERIS
I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
TIFA
We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
BARRET
Later! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator!
RED XIII
Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor!
No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do.
To prove it to you…here, this is the key card to the 68th Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?
BARRET
Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
TIFA
Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.
AERIS
Not that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
You don't have a Card Key
CLOUD
H, hey! What is it?
Rude
Would you press 'Up' please?
CLOUD
Turks! Must be a trap…
Tseng
This must've been a real thrill for you… Did you enjoy it?
CLOUD
Ggh…
CLOUD
They got you, too?
CLOUD
Where is AERIS!?
President Shinra
In a safe place.
President Shinra
She's the last surviving Ancient…
President Shinra
Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history.
RED XIII
Cetra…that girl is a survivor of the Cetra?
President Shinra
Cetra, or the Ancients, will show us the way to the 'Promised Land'. I'm expecting a lot out of her.
RED XIII
The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
President Shinra
Even so, it's far too appealing not to pursue.
It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile.
…If the land is fertile…
BARRET
then there's gotta be Mako!
President Shinra
Exactly. That is why our money making Mako Reactor is necessary.
The abundant Mako will flow out on its own.
President Shinra
That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory…
BARRET
@$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
President Shinra
Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power.
President Shinra
Well, that is all for our meeting.
BARRET
Hold it! I got a lot to say to you!
President Shinra
If there's anything else… talk to my secretary.
Rude
Come on! Outta his way!
I wonder how BARRET is doing
I wonder how RED XIII is doing

Psst (Can we get out?)
TIFA
Psst (CLOUD, you're so brave!)
TIFA
Psst (Don't give up!)
BARRET
Hey!
BARRET
AERIS is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.
The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.
BARRET
I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.
BARRET
Is that right?
BARRET
The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.
BARRET
Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy.
BARRET
…and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.
BARRET
I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin'new members!!
Me, TIFA, CLOUD… and AERIS too.
BARRET
How 'bout you?
BARRET
You're so damn boring.
RED XIII
…………Grandpa.
BARRET
Grandpa!?  Ha, ha, ha…… Grandpa, hmm……ha, ha, ha……
RED XIII
What's so funny?
BARRET
Nothin'……ha, ha
AERIS
CLOUD, are you there?
CLOUD
AERIS!? You safe?
AERIS
Yeah, I'm all right.
AERIS
I knew that CLOUD would come for me.
CLOUD
Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?
AERIS
The deal was for one date, right?
TIFA
…………oh, I get it.
AERIS
…!? TIFA! TIFA, you're there too!
TIFA
EXCUSE me.
TIFA
You know, AERIS. I have a question.
AERIS
What?
TIFA
Does the Promised Land really exist?
AERIS
…I don't know.
AERIS
All I know is…
The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.
And……then…
The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.
TIFA
…What does that mean?
AERIS
More than words……I don't know.
CLOUD
…Speak with the Planet?
TIFA
Just what does the Planet say?
AERIS
It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
CLOUD
You hear it now?
AERIS
I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is…my real mother.
AERIS
Someday I'll get out of Midgar… Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land.
…That's what mom said.
I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but…
CLOUD
What's happened?
CLOUD
The door's open… When did it open?
TIFA
……
CLOUD
TIFA… Wake up!
TIFA
What's wrong?
CLOUD
Something's wrong. Look outside.
TIFA
This's kinda eerie…
TIFA
I wonder what happened…
CLOUD
He should have the key on him…
CLOUD
Come on, TIFA, get AERIS. I'll go help BARRET and the others.
CLOUD
AERIS
AERIS
…What happened?
AERIS
Must've been attacked by…
CLOUD
BARRET, RED XIII …come with me. Something's wrong.
BARRET
How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
BARRET
The hell's goin' on!?
RED XIII
No human could've done this.
RED XIII
I'll go on ahead.
BARRET
I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!
TIFA
Come on, let's follow RED XIII!
RED XIII
Jenova Specimen… Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
RED XIII
It looks like it leads up…
BARRET
He's dead… The head of Shinra is dead…
TIFA
Then this sword must be…
CLOUD
Sephiroth's!!
TIFA
…Sephiroth is alive?
CLOUD
…Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
BARRET
Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra!
Uh!
Palmer
P, p, p, please, don't kill me!
CLOUD
What happened?
Palmer
Se…Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
CLOUD
Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
Palmer
Yeah, I saw him! With my own eyes!
CLOUD
You really saw him?
Palmer
Uh! Would I lie at a time like this!? I heard his voice, too!
Palmer
Um, he said something about not letting us have the Promised Land.
TIFA
Then does that mean
the Promised Land really does exist and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
BARRET
So he's a good guy then?
CLOUD
Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!
It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
BARRET
Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!
TIFA
Who's that?
BARRET
Vice President Rufus. The President's son.
RED XIII
I only know his name.
BARRET
I heard that he'd been assigned somewhere else for a long time…
TIFA
I wonder what sort of person he is?
AERIS
I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
Rufus
So… So Sephiroth was actually here. …By the way,
Rufus
just who are you?
CLOUD
I'm CLOUD, ex-SOLDIER, First Class!
BARRET
I'm from AVALANCHE!
TIFA
Me too!
AERIS
A flower girl from the slums.
RED XIII
A Research Specimen.
Rufus
What a crew.
Rufus
Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.
BARRET
You're only President 'cause yer old man died!
Rufus
Correct. I'll let you hear my inauguration speech.
Rufus
…Father tried to control the world with money and that worked for him.
Rufus
The people believed that Shinra would protect them.
Rufus
Work at Shinra, get your pay. If terrorists attack, the Shinra army will help you.
It looked perfect on the outside.
Rufus
But, I do things differently.
I'll control the world with fear. It's too much to do it like my old man.
Rufus
A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste good money on them.
TIFA
He likes to make speeches just like his father.
CLOUD
Get AERIS outta the building!
BARRET
What?
CLOUD
I'll explain later! BARRET! This is the real crisis for the Planet!
BARRET
The hell's that supposed to mean?
CLOUD
I'll explain later! Just take my word for now! I'll go after I take care of him!
BARRET
Alright, CLOUD!
Rufus
Why do you want to fight me?
CLOUD
You want the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
Rufus
That's right.
Rufus
Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
CLOUD
…Whatever, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!
Rufus
I see. I guess we won't be allies.

Where's Rufus?
CLOUD
I couldn't finish 'em. This is gonna get complicated.
AERIS
CLOUD… I just thought of something.
TIFA
…I'll wait for CLOUD! Everyone, get to the elevator!
AERIS
Hmm, it's going to get pretty ugly from here on. We should check on our equipment.

AERIS
Quickly, we can escape this way…
BARRET
I'll go on ahead!
BARRET
*&^%(*… We're surrounded!
If I was alone this wouldn't be a thing, but I gotta reputation to protect.
AERIS
You all get out while you can.
It's not you they're after… it's me.
BARRET
Yeah, well that ain't happenin'.
You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to help you!
BARRET
OK, playtime's over jackasses…
AERIS
…Thank you, Mr. BARRET!
BARRET
Who you callin' Mr. BARRET? That don't sound right!
RED XIII
Well then…
If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way to get out of here.
BARRET
Huh? Oh, oh yeah… You're cold, man. Just like someone else 'round here I know.
RED XIII
Did you say something?
BARRET
Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?
TIFA
BARRET!!
BARRET
TIFA! Where's CLOUD?
TIFA
Everyone! Over here!
BARRET
Huh? What's up? Where's CLOUD?
TIFA
He's coming! Hurry, Hurry!!
AERIS
Quickly! We'll escape this way…
CLOUD
Nope. Have to find another way up, I guess…

BARRET
Well, what do we do now?
CLOUD
Sephiroth is alive. …I have to settle the score.
BARRET
Will that save the Planet?
CLOUD
…It seems so.
BARRET
Then, I'm going!
AERIS
I'll go, too. There are things I need to know.
CLOUD
About the Ancients?
AERIS
…Many things.
TIFA
I guess it's good bye, Midgar.
BARRET
We told AERIS's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe, too.
Yeah, she should be
Hmm, I don't know
AERIS
She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. …Maybe it's for the best.
AERIS
Stop it, CLOUD! I'm worried, too.
AERIS
You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar…
Really? Are you worried?
It's dangerous. Are you sure you want to go?
AERIS
A little…no, maybe a lot. But I have a bodyguard, right?
AERIS
I thought you'd say that!
TIFA
…I guess this is the start of our journey…
You hate traveling?
It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?
TIFA
…I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.
TIFA
…Hmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise.
RED XIII
I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.
CLOUD
Then…
Let's stay here for a while
Let's go!
BARRET
To the Northeast, there's a town called Kalm.
The food at the Inn's good. Why don't we head there first?
AERIS
You're right. I've heard about that town before. CLOUD?
BARRET
About Sephiroth, and about the crisis of the Planet…
CLOUD
You're right. We need to know where Sephiroth went.
BARRET
We need a leader for our journey. Course that could only be me.
TIFA
You think so?
AERIS
I think it should be CLOUD.
BARRET
^#$^%…alright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.
BARRET
'Sides, we can't have five people strolling around out there. It's too dangerous. Let's split into two parties…

BARRET
Later, at Kalm!
That's funny…I dropped the key to this gate…somewhere. Must've been on that excavation tour.
