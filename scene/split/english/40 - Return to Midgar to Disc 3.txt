Heidegger is going after you all.
That's why it's dangerous out there. Let's go underground!
This way!
Alright, let's go!
What's wrong? Are you still looking for something?
What's wrong? You're blowing us off!
Wassup, Mr. Monster? What're you lookin' at?
Something's wrong…
What's going on?
Doesn't look like it's after us. Something else…
Huh? It's looking somewhere else. Doesn't it want to fight us?
No, it's…feeling something. …Yeah, it senses murder.
Let's go to the Airship!
To my ship!
Let's go back to the Highwind!
Let's watch from the Airship!
Let's go back to the Airship.
We should go back to the ship now.
OK, can we GO now!?
Oh no! We gotta get outta here!
Something big… I'm talkin' REALLY BIG's comin'!
Gya, ha, ha, Mr. President, preparations for Sister Ray are now underway.
Anytime is fine.
…Fire.
deck
I see! They're after Sephiroth! The crater on the Northern boundary!
Damn…
Which direction is it going to attack?
Midgar!
It went right through Weapon…
(operator)
Sir! Weapon's been defeated!!
The barrier has disappeared!
(operator)
Sir! A mass of high density energy is heading towards Midgar!
WH00A-- Weapon's attacking!
Run for your lives!!
What happened to Sephiroth?
Northern Cave…
Let's go see what happened to it.
Strange. I can't reach the President!
Huh? Why are you giving the orders?
Not the President. To Sister Ray!
None of that matters!
The reactor's output is increasing all by itself!
We can't do that! It's inoperable!
What about the mainframe? Who!?
Hey, call the mainframe!
I don't care how you do it!!
Kya, haa, haa. What is it Reeve? You're speaking strangely.
Wait a minute. That's not wise!
It must cool for 3 hours or it won't work. Reeve, shut off the machine!
Someone has switched the machine over to mainframe operation!
We can't operate it from here.
Looks like CLOUD and the others are on their way. Stay out of the way!
That's a private matter…
Hey! Wait!!
CLOUD, everybody! Sorry…
But!!
Don't be foolish! I don't remember anyone putting you in charge!
The Peace Preservation force will do their best to beat the enemy!
Because of them, I… I…
The President is dead! Now I'm doing things my way!
Kya, ha, ha.
Heidegger! Now I'm going to use the new weapon!
Ha, ha, ha… Just you wait, Sephiroth.
I'll give you all the Mako you want.
Hojo, STOP! The cannon, no, Midgar itself is in danger!
Ha, ha, ha… One or two Midgars? …It's a small price to pay.
Hojo!  HOJO!!
Show me…Sephiroth.
It should be near…
Ha, ha, ha… Go beyond the powers of science…
Before your presence, science is powerless…
I don't like it, but I'll comply.
Just…let me see it.
Bridge
Sephiroth's energy barrier is gone…
CID! Can the Airship get inside?
Right, sorry about that.
Yo, CAIT SITH! Now what?
Huh? He's my pilot, ain't he!? Of course he can go anywhere!
Scarlet! Heidegger! What's going on?
Can't you stop the Mako reactor?
Must stop Hojo…first.
YO! Do somethin'! Ya big cat!
You're busted, Reeve!
Too late tryin' to hide it now…
You're from Shinra, ain't ya? So why's it impossible!?
An explosion!!
We came a long way to get here. You better not double-cross us now!
You damn fool! Don't you understand anything I'm saying?
I don't give a damn about Shinra. If you're a man… no, if you're a human being, you'll save the planet! Don't you even care?
Why? Can't you just shut off the valve?
We're sunk. Hojo's doing this on his own…
…? …? Huh?
I don't like this…
Forget that…the CANNON! We've got to get to Midgar! That's the first thing!!
…We can't stop it.
I can't make you trust me…
No way! If we shut down the reactor, all hell will break loose!!
Yeah, it's easy to shut off the reactor's pipe valves…
But the reactor made a path for the energy to escape from below.
Once you open that, it'll be impossible to close it until everything blasts out…
And we can't try to stop the energy from gushing out…
This blast'll be way stronger than when the Sector 1 Reactor blew up!
I know!
But you'll come, won't you!?
Hey!
I'm leaving the ship in your hands!
I'm heading for Midgar!
Even if we get there, Midgar's under martial law!
There'll be no way we could slip into the slums.
Looks like all transportation from the slums is cut off…
Hey, hey, whaddya think we have Highwind for?
Where are we now!?
Huh? Where are we?
If land's no go… We'll go by air!
Okay then! We'll parachute into Midgar!!
We've reached Midgar!
Inside airship
Here we go!!
Choose from the members below.
Leave it as is?
Change
This is where we go in.
May sound strange comin' from me…
But it feels like bein' back in Midgar.
Kinda makes me sick...
We sure got to know the Midgar underground.
Please! Hurry to the Mako Cannon!
I have an old score to settle with Hojo, so let's go!
Yeah! Let's get it over with!
This place smells gross. Let's get this over with!
So it was Hojo who stirred up all this commotion after all these years?
Leave this to me! Hurry to the cannon!
I'm all right! Go to the cannon!
This way, CLOUD!
I smell it! The cannon's not this way!
Forget about these lackeys! Focus on Hojo!
Which way?
Goddamn, piece of $#@^% cannon!!
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon---!
Damn! Hojo!
Oh no! They're here!
What are we going to do? I think you can ignore your orders now.
…Elena, don't act so weak.
We're Turks, Elena.
…Yes, sir. You're right.
Reno! You're still alive…
I've never swam so much in my life.
Come on, we've got work to do.
I'm not really up for it, but…
Our orders were to seek you out and …
…Kill.
Our company may be in turmoil, but an order's an order.
That's the spirit of the Turks! Believe it!
What are you doing? Let's go!
Okay, let's end this
I know we have a weird relationship, but…
We have to end this… like Turks!
What is that, pity!? Don't think the Turks are fools!
Wait, Elena.
Reno! You're not disobeying…are you!?
Shinra's finished. It's come down to this.
Rude…
Elena, you were a great Turk!
Farewell. If we both survive…
and our lives are spared…
Remember the spirit of the Turks!
Our mission's over…
What the… hell is that!!?
This can't be…
Are you serious?
Hey-hey! You serious?
No, no way… I didn't know they completed it…
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! Here they come!
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! So they really showed up!
You sure treated us like dogs till now!!
You killed many of my precious soldiers!
G'yaaa, Haaa, Haaa!!! But let's see how you do against anti-Weapon artillery!
You guys are worthless, but my proud creation is great!
I'll show you the destructive power of the Proud Clod!
Not that! This is the Proud Clod!?
Whoooooa!!
We don't have any time! Please get on with it!
Hojo!  Stop right there!!
Oh…the Failure.
At least remember my name! It's CLOUD!
Every time I see you…
It pains me that I had so little scientific sense…
I saw you as a failed project.
But, you're the only one that succeeded as a Sephiroth-clone.
Heh, heh, heh… I'm even beginning to hate myself.
None of that matters… just stop this nonsense!
…Nonsense?
Oh, this?
Sephiroth seems to be counting on the energy.
So I'm going to lend him a hand.
Why!? Why do that!?
Quit asking me why, you moron.
Hmm…actually, you might make a good scientist.
Energy level is at…83%. It's taking too long.
My son needs power and help. …That's the only reason.
…Your son?
Ha, ha, ha… But he doesn't know it.
Ha, ha, ha… HA, HA, HA!!
What will Sephiroth think when he finds out I'm his father?
He always looks down on me.
HA, HA, HA!!
Sephiroth is your son!?
Ha, ha, ha…
I offered the woman with my child to Professor Gast's Jenova Project.
When Sephiroth was still in her womb, we took Jenova's cells…
You!
I can't believe you're the one who did this…
Illusionary crime against Sephiroth…
Heee, hee, hee! No, you're wrong!
It's my desire as a scientist! Heee, hee, hee!
I was…wrong. The one that should have slept was…
…You, Hojo!
I…was defeated by my drive to become a scientist.
I lost the last time, too.
I've injected Jenova's cells into my own body!
Heee, hee, hee!
Here are…
…the results!!
 %$#&$*&^%^
Hojo… Rest in peace…
I can't believe Sephiroth is Hojo's son…
The father…
How sad…for him…
I'm so glad you came.
That's the end of the cannon…
Hey! This is…
Received Missing Score!
This is great. Hold on, Hojo!
Dead end!
Shinra's…finished.
Meteor's gonna fall in about…
Seven more days. That's what Grandfather said.
RED XIII…
You want to see everyone in Cosmo Canyon again?
…Yes.
You want to see Marlene, right?
Don't ask me that.
We'll beat Sephiroth…
Then, if we don't release the power of Holy in seven days… There won't be a Planet left to protect.
If we can't beat Sephiroth…
It's as good as death for us.
We'll just go a few days sooner than the rest who'll die from Meteor.
Don't think you're gonna lose before ya even fight!
No!
What I meant was…
What are we all fighting for? I want us all to understand that.
Save the Planet…for the future of the Planet… Sure, that's all fine.
But really, is that how it is?
For me, this is a personal feud.
I want to beat Sephiroth and settle my past.
Saving the Planet just happens to be part of that.
I've been thinking.
I think we all are fighting for ourselves.
For ourselves…and that someone… something…whatever it is, that's important to us. That's what we're fighting for.
That's why we keep up this battle for the Planet.
You're right…
It sounds cool sayin' it's to save the Planet.
But I was the one who blew up that Mako reactor……
Lookin' back on it now, I can see that wasn't the right way to do things.
I made a lot of friends and innocent bystanders suffer…
…At first, it was revenge against Shinra. For attackin' my town.
But now…
Yeah. I'm fightin' for Marlene.
For Marlene… For Marlene's future…
Yeah…I guess I want to save the Planet for Marlene's sake…
Go and see her. Make sure you're right, and come back.
All of you. Get off the ship and find out your reasons for yourselves.
I want you to make sure. Then I want you to come back.
Maybe ain't none of us'll come back.
Meteor's gonna kill us all anyway. Let's just forget any useless struggling!
I know why I'm fighting. I'm fighting to save the Planet, and that's that.
But besides that, there's something personal, too… A very personal memory that I have.
What about you all? I want all of you to find that something within yourselves.
If you don't find it, then that's okay, too. You can't fight without a reason, right?
So, I won't hold it against you if you don't come back.
What are you going to do, TIFA?
Did you forget?
I'm…all alone. I don't have anywhere to go.
Twilight Hill
Everyone's gone…
Yeah, we don't have anywhere or anyone to go home to.
You're right…
But…I'm sure someday… they'll come back, don't you think?
Hmm… I wonder…
Everyone has something irreplaceable they're holding on to…
But this time, our opponent…
Hmm…But that's all right, if no one comes back.
As long as we're together. With you by my side, I'll never give up no matter how bad it gets.
… TIFA…
No matter how close we are now… We were far apart before.
But when we were in the Lifestream surrounded by all those screams of anguish, I thought I heard your voice…
…sniff…you probably don't remember this…
But deep in my heart I heard you calling my name… Or at least I thought I did…
Yeah… I heard you calling me.
You were calling me back from the consciousness in the Lifestream.
After all, I promised that if anything ever happened to you, I'd come to help.
CLOUD…? Do you think the stars can hear us?
Do you think they see how hard we're fighting for them?
I dunno… But…
Whether they can or not, we still have to do what we can. And believe in ourselves…
Someday we'll find the answer. Right, TIFA? That's what I learned from you when I was in the Lifestream.
Yes…that's right…
Hey TIFA… I… There were so many things I wanted to say to you.
But now that we're together like this, I don't know what to say…
CLOUD… Words aren't the only thing that tell people what you're thinking…
…
I'll find the answer someday. As long as I keep trying.
We've got a big battle tomorrow, we'd better get some sleep…
Umm. I guess you're right…
I think I've heard it, too. Then, it was TIFA's voice…
Highwind – Before the Decisive Battle
… It's almost dawn…
H, huh?
Sorry. Did I wake you? It's almost dawn, TIFA.
Umm… G, good morning… CLOUD.
Just a little longer… A little bit longer…
This day will never come again… So let me have this moment…
Sure…
This might be the last time we'll ever be together…
We'd better go.
But, I still…!?
It'll be all right, TIFA. You said so yourself yesterday.
At least we don't have to go on alone.
Yes… That's right!
Okay! Let's go!
Morning, TIFA. It's almost dawn…
Mmm… Good morning, CLOUD.
No one's…back yet.
That's just the way it is TIFA. It was their choice to make.
What are you going to do, CLOUD?
I'm…a coward. I don't even have the guts to call it quits here.
What's wrong with me? I guess…I'm scared.
CLOUD! Say everything'll be fine!
Everything'll be fine!
Wow!
I don't know why, but suddenly I feel like everything'll be fine.
This airship is too big for just the two of us.
Yeah, it's a little lonely without everyone.
Don't worry. It'll be okay.
I'll make a big enough ruckus for everyone.
Besides, I'm the pilot.
No more flying around casually like before.
We won't have time to feel lonely.
It's moving…
Let's go TIFA.
BARRET! CID!
O, oh…is that okay with you?
RED XIII!
Why didn't you tell me!?
But, you know, CID.
Hey, RED XIII.
If you butt in now, you never know what they'll say later…
…Were you watching?
…Were you listening?
VINCENT!
Why such a puzzled look?
Don't you want me to come?
No, it's just that you're always so cool to what is happening I thought you didn't care.
Cool?
Hmm… I guess that's just how I am, sorry.
Well looky-here. The Shinra Manager's come back.
Uh, excuse me but…
I wanted to come with the main group, but I couldn't get away…
So some people in Midgar took me in.
I know I have a stuffed animal body, but I'll work really hard!
I guess that's everyone.
No, YUFFIE's missing.
She ain't gonna show up.
'Least this time she didn't steal our Materia. Thank god for that.
How could you say that!?
After I came this far with you, even with my airsickness!
I didn't go through all that just to have you guys have the best parts all to yourselves!
Welcome back, YUFFIE.
Gee, CLOUD…that's so nice of you to say that…You sick or somethin'?
Well, whatever. I'm gonna be in my reserved seat in the hall… waiting…upp…Urk!
Thanks everyone.
We didn't come back for your spikey-headed ass!
I came back for Marlene. Guess it's jus' my… feelings or somethin'.
I, uh I ain't got no words now…
…Although she's not here, she left us a window of opportunity…
We can't let it go like this.
…AERIS. She was smiling to the end.
We can't just let it end with that smile, we have to do something.
Let's all go together.
Memories of AERIS…
Although she should've returned to the Planet by now, something stopped her and now she's stuck…
We've got to let go of AERIS's memory.
Has anyone here changed their mind?
What the hell was up with CLOUD anyway?
He was a Sephiroth-clone created by Hojo.
They really make those?
Well he wasn't made from scratch.
They implanted Jenova cells into a normal human being and then infused it with Mako energy.
Well then, what is CLOUD?
But why only CLOUD?
You guys!!
Geez…that's pretty lame.”
I stuck in there even when I was pukin' from bein' so seasick.
But if you think I stuck through all this just to make off with everything when the time's right, forget it. That's not my style.
Ain't no one wanna be thanked by you!
So, what's next. Now that everyone's here. What're you going to do?
This is our last battle. Our target is Sephiroth in the Northern Cave! So…
Let's do it. Come on, everyone!
How are you feeling?
You ought to rest a bit… Don't push yourself.
CLOUD…what should I do? I've got to think.
The Planet's…scream.
Did Bugenhagen…tell you anything?
I wonder what AERIS felt… when she was on that altar…?
I'm sure she wanted to give her life for the Planet.
Really? I wonder? I don't think that was it.
I don't think she wanted to die at all, but was planning on coming back all along.
She always used to talk about the 'next time'.
She talked about the future more than any of us…
Although she never said anything to us about it, she must've had a rough life.
I think AERIS looked forward to tomorrow and the future more than anyone…
…she must've had many many dreams…
Whether you love it or hate it…
You just can't bring yourself to leave Midgar, can you?
Now we're going to fight Sephiroth.
I wonder what the inside of that cave looks like? You think Sephiroth is just sitting there waiting for Meteor?
It's all right.
You're here… Everyone's all together
Together…we can do anything. We've worked this hard already.
Hey, CLOUD… Would you tell me 'It's all right'?
Say it cool
Say it normal
Don't say it
…I just can't say it that easy.
Now I feel like things are really going to be all right. Thanks, CLOUD.
You're right, things will be all right.
I'm sorry…I guess you're right.
I'm all right. I'm not going to chicken out at the last minute.
I'm…all right…really… I'll fight my hardest…
……Wow. I guess…I am a little scared. My knees are trembling.
I'm counting on you, CID.
Yeah, yeah…
These two levers have been buggin' me for a while…
Let me try them out.
Do whatever you have to.
All right, so what should I do?
You decide, CLOUD.
This is our last battle.
Our target is the North Cave. Our enemy is…Sephiroth!
We're almost to the North Cave! We're on our way, Sephiroth!
Man, I'm going to stick it to him!
What is it, CID?
Errrrggh! Some incredible force! Losing…control…
CID.
Captain
Here, sir!
Get the hell outta here, flunkies! Didn't I tell you all to go home!?
Yes, sir. But, this is our home!!
Oh ma--…stop trying to act so cool.
All right, you jokers! Hold me down with everything you got!!
Geronimo!!
( End Disc 2 )
C'mon, CLOUD! Don't #&$* around!
We're goin' to Junon!!
Them Shinras think they're gonna fight Meteor with the Huge Materia?
Damn, it kinda makes me sad…
That Bugenhagen guy… He was a weird old dude.
I used to think he was a naturalist, but he was all into them machines.
And AERIS…she's dead.
Guess she turned into Spiritual Energy and returned to the Planet, huh?
But even if she did, there's no way we'll meet her again…
Whacha gonna do, CLOUD? Got any good ideas?
That damn Weapon… He's one big *&$*&%$…
Even Midgar's in trouble now.
When AVALANCHE was startin' out, we used to put up flyers everywhere.
And now, we're up against Sephiroth. How about that?
Feels like a long time ago.
Comin' and goin'… gettin' pushed around.
But I got a debt to all them back in Midgar that I can't never repay…
Heh heh heh… Time's got a way of sneakin' up on ya, huh?
I'm shakin' all over… Heh heh…I feel sick…
I'm glad you're back with us!
Shinra only cares if things are good right now.
But, I plan to live for 500 years and won't stand for that type of thinking.
Yes. We have to think about what to do.
Hurry, hurry! We must go meet Grandfather!
AERIS used to pat me on the nose sometimes.
I used to hate being treated like a child like that, but I also liked the attention.
I wanted to apologize to her for what I did when we first met.
If I were more of an adult, perhaps I would have a better idea of what to do?
Whew…I wish I could grow up. I wonder if after all this is over, will I be an adult?
Midgar…
I hated the fact I was caught by Hojo and taken back to the lab where they did all kinds of experiments on me…
But because of that I was able to meet you all…
People you want to meet… others you don't…strange isn't it?
Will we save the world if we beat Sephiroth?
I'm frightened, but I'll do my best. Let's hurry to the Northern Cave!
I wonder why Hojo performed so many of these experiments?
Why couldn't he content himself with quiet research?
I am Nanaki, son of Seto… I am afraid of nothing…
It's all right, all right. I'm Nanaki, the son of brave Seto… I'm not afraid of Sephiroth…
Escape from a world of illusions… Hmph…I wonder which is better…?
…how does it feel, CLOUD? living for no one but yourself?
…feelings alone aren't enough. …it's irritating, isn't it CLOUD?
The machines in Cosmo Canyon were presents of Dr. Gast.
Wrapped up in the Planet's strange notions surrounded by Shinra-made machines…
Science and the Planet lived side by side in that old man's heart.
City of the Ancients…
The Ancients…in time that is probably what later generations will call us.
Hmm…hwa ha ha ha… It's only a matter of time for us.
……we still can't seem to get near Sephiroth…
Kill Sephiroth… Killing the son of my beloved woman…
Am I on the verge of committing another sin? Or am I atoning as best I can for only standing by?
Hojo…what a queer fellow.
Such utter lack of scientific talent… compared with the genius of Dr. Gast…
Lucrecia chose him in order to protect him.
Now I understand… I understand…but…
CLOUD…take the ship to the Northern Cave.
The time for flying is now past. Our battlefield is now beneath the earth…
The gate to tomorrow is not the light of heaven, but the darkness of the depths of the earth.
This is kind of sudden, but shouldn't we get to Junon!?
The Shinra are all gathered at CID's Rocket Town…
…I love giving out secrets more than anything.
…That's not to say I don't know how the President feels.
But, I can't shake the feeling he's rushin' things a bit…
The life of the Planet…
Which was screaming? The Planet? Or Meteor?
Just between you and me…
That Bugenhagen used to be a Shinra worker.
He never bought any weapons or Mako though…
I told AERIS's Mom about her death.
Elmyra was cried herself silly… So did little Marlene…
Lately, they don't call me to meetings. Probably because you know I'm a spy.
CLOUD, you make sure and do your best!
I know you can't forgive the Shinra, but the people in Midgar haven't done any wrong!
…Wonder what Sephiroth's up to?
I can't apologize to you enough.
If I was a better person, none of this would have happened…
So let's get over it! We've got to hurry to the slums!
Are you all right? You say you lost your son?
Hey, CLOUD!
The people ought to just about be to safety in the slums by now.
Maybe we were all just kidding ourselves.
But I won't forget, no matter what happens.
Not about this here trip, or them folks--none of it!
I know how tough it is bein' a leader, because I've been one.
I always forget who has what Materia.
You said there's somethin' goin' on at Rocket Town…?
I TOLD you I was thinkin' about it!
Maybe it's just me, but has this ship been remodeled without me knowin' it?
All these switches and levers. They're kinda gettin' to me.
AERIS?
I wanted to give her a ride in the Highwind…
Phew…CLOUD. What're we gonna do?
Well, I guess it's time for Sephiroth. Are your hearts pounding?
That reminds me of a test rocket that landed in the Midgar Slums long ago.
I remember how relieved I was when I heard it never blew up.
Maybe this is the time?
This runnin' back and forth is tough!
Even my bikini goddess would be pantin' about now!
You ever see the play 'LOVELESS'?
No
Yes
Yeah, I figured someone like you wouldn't be much on plays.
Yeah? Really? Well, that's fine.
They've been doin' that play every summer since I was a kid.
An' I remember seein' it just once…
That was when I was in Midgar training to be a pilot.
I had some free time and thought I'd catch the play.
Now, I'm no big fan of the theater or anything.
But this thing put me to sleep, just like I thought it would.
Finally during the last scene, the guy next to me woke me up tellin' me my snorin' was too loud.
So about all I really remember of that play is the end…
When the sister of the lead asks her lover,
Do you really have to leave?
And the guy says,
I made a promise. The people I love are waiting.
…I don't understand. Not at all. But, take care of yourself.
Of course…I'll come back to you. Even if you don't promise to wait. I'll return knowing you'll be here.
I remember thinking when I heard those lines,
What the hell's he talkin' about? But, you know…now I'm not so sure…
I think I understand…
When this job's done, I'm landing the ship… yeah, that's what I'll do.
Sorry, I'm in the middle of a very delicate operation!
Ahhhhh! Oh no, oh no, oh no!
