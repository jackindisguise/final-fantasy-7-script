Wilderness
Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!
What!? What happened all of a sudden?
What!? The hell happened all of a sudden!?
What the--? Did something happen?
What happened all of a sudden? Don't scare me like that!
Wh, wh, what is it, all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!
What the HELL is it! Shoutin' out and jumpin' in front of me all of a sudden!
What happened all of a sudden? Did something happen?
I know this area pretty well.
It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready…
…Hmmm… Something's fishy…
You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?
You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?
Hah, I know what you're thinkin'. And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?
…You serious? And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?
I don't trust you.
…Really? Somehow, I don't believe it.
Are you trying to con us again?
…Really? Something tells me I shouldn't trust you.
Are you going to trick us again?
Hmm… Smells fishy.
Are you going to trick us again?
My nose never lies!
You serious? I can't trust you.
But then again, I guess I shouldn't talk.
Hey! You serious?
If you're trying to con us, you won't get away with it!
Further down? I don't see any signs of danger…
There's something unnatural in the way YUFFIE's acting…
No! It's REALLY tough…
There they are, catch 'em!!
Shinra!?
The Shinra!?
The Shinra!!
That's Sh…Shinra's…
What, the Shinra!?
It's Shinra!!
The Shinra!
Shinra Soldier
Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!
YUFFIE, did you by any chance…
YUFFIE, so you're…
YUFFIE, you're not…
So you were, YUFFIE!!
Not bad, YUFFIE, not bad at all.
YUFFIE! You sure got some nerve, kid!
So what does this mean? You will explain later.
I didn't know! I had nothing to do with this one!
This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?
So you WERE up to something!
Whaddya mean 'this one'!? This one'?
So you WERE plannin' somethin'!!
This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?
So you WERE trying something!
What do you mean 'this one'? THIS one'?
So you were concocting some evil scheme!!
This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?
So you were planning on tricking us!
Whaddya mean 'THIS one'? THIS one'!?
So you WERE planning some crooked $%*&!!
What do you mean, 'This one'?
You had something else in mind?
No, umm, uh…
What should we do!?
Uh…Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!
What's going on!?
I thought something was missing… my Materia's all gone!!
The hell's goin' on!?
I knew somethin' was missing. All my Materia's gone!!
What's going on!?
I thought something was odd… My, my Materia is missing!!
What's going on?
I thought something was funny, my Materia's disappeared!!
What's going on!?
Something's missing…my Materia…it's gone!!
What the hell's goin' on?
I knew I was missing something… My Materia's gone!!
I thought something was wrong. So that's it.
My Materia's been stolen…
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Now…where's YUFFIE?
Ey…where the hell's that damn kid?
I'm SO mad!!
That &*&$ kid!!!
Grrrrrgh!! Arrrrrgh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
She's done it again!!
I'll never forgive her!
ZOUNDS!!
Grrrrrrrgh… Grrrgh! Grrrrrgh!!
She's done it again!
She sure took us for fools!
That little ^%#^$@!!
Takin' me for a fool!!
Inexcusable…
She was probably eyeing our Materia from the beginning.
It looks like she went North. Let's hurry after her and get our Materia back!
She was after our Materia from the start!!
She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our Materia back!
C'mon! We're goin' after her!
She was after our Materia from the beginning.
She won't get away with this! I'm pretty sure she ran off North. Let's go after her!!
Her objective was stealing our Materia from the beginning.
…sniff… North! She ran off to the North!
I'm not going to let her get away with this! Hurry, hurry! We have to get our Materia back!
She must've been after our Materia from the beginning.
We can't just let her get away, right? Then, let's hurry after her! Which way? It's North, the North! It's a message from the stars!
No doubt about it! That kid was after our Materia from the start!!
Hmm… Looks like she went North.
Don't drag your asses! We're going right NOW! That $#@^% is history!!
Seems as though all that she was after was our Materia.
We can't just let her get away. She ran to the North…
We must go after her and retrieve our Materia back.
Hey, we gotta problem! Our Materia's all gone!!
O…OH NO! All of our Materia…gone!?
Wutai
Hey!!
Life is just like a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.
Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.
YUFFIE? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.
Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether Meteor falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
Lord Godo is in this house.
He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep…
What, YUFFIE… It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.
But today he's not in the best of… Well, I should say… But really he's not so…
Anyhow, for some reason YUFFIE's had a fondness for Materia ever since I can remember.
She's always hung around places she thought might have it.
That's just how she is. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.
Other times she'll hide in the shadows just like a little kid.
That reminds me, lately I've seen a kid around here that reminds me of YUFFIE.
Always sneakin' around corners and doin' somethin' she shouldn't.
She's always getting into fights. I guess she takes after Godo that way.
Like father like daughter…
Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is popular with the kids now?
One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like YUFFIE.
Hm, money? There's all kinds of money.
This type and that… Hey now that you mention it, there was some money over there.
The end is right in front of us…
But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life, day in and day out…
Alright, alright, alright! I know!
On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!
I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!
A girl with Materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.
You know I've noticed that there's a pounding noise from time to time in this store.
Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!
Alright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!
He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he was floatin'! He almost bowled me over!
When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust! Can't we do anything?
This is MY house! Nobody gets in!
You can't get away, YUFFIE.
Give it up, YUFFIE!
You lost, YUFFIE.
O…OK, I know… I was wrong…
You win. I'll give you back your Materia…
I don't think she came out from here… Is that OK?
Wait, that damn YUFFIE's gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! You jus' gonna leave?
Knowing YUFFIE, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be hiding around here somewhere!
She couldn't have left town… I think she is must still be here. Or, do you want to go on?

Wutai‚ Old Man's House
Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see…what was your name?
No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!
Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?
No, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!
Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon at noon. Everyone's celebrating.
No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's scared of it!!
What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I…
Oh no! More weirdos!
No, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird, too!
Bar [Turtle Paradise]
Yy, you!? How did you get here?
Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.
Get ready to die!!
Elena, you talk too much.
Ww, what?
What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
We're taking a vacation and resting up from our work.
Now our vacation is ruined.
B, but…
Even the booze tastes bad now.
…Sorry…
Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team?
Being a Turk's been hard at times, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.
After all, I got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
To the Turks… To Reno…cheers!
Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!
The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
Hey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.
Nowadays, Wutai's just able to get by thanks to the tourists.
Seems like the town got really lively since you arrived. Did anything happen?
First the ground started shaking, then that large star…
Y, you think… It's all over?
Hey. You think the store feels gloomy?
Let's just say that I like things quiet.
It's been really loud and busy outside.
Someone outside must be up to something bad…
With things the way they are in the world I guess there's nothing I can do about it.
Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all might as well sit back and have a beer…
So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!
We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
…What a drag.
Ww, what was that?
We're off duty now and can't save your butts.
We know you're off duty, but…
If you knew, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.
But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
All right, fine! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!
And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?
I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk, would act!?
Elena. Don't misunderstand.
Those who sacrifice themselves for their job aren't pros… …just fools.
Rude?
Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way.
… It's just that we're off duty!
I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.
They say the Water God was a huge snake!
Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.
But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.
Believe in the scales of the Water God and in Materia that has its power in it.
Congrats! You have just found all six flyers for the "Turtle's Paradise"! 
How wonderful! Now here is your prize, just as we promised!!
Please come again to "Turtle's Paradise"! We're looking forward to seeing you!
Wutai‚Pagoda
That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods…
The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni. Omni has the best of the others.
For generations, we in Wutai have worshipped Da-chao the Water God.
Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.
But, in the last battle, we didn't fare so well… I guess our beliefs were only based on legend.
Have you ever heard of the Water God's scales?
They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. They're impervious to the strongest flames.
But, of course, I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Meteor's gonna make when it crashes down.
Hmm… Corneo's good at escaping…
…Elena.
Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.
That sounded okay.
If he has Elena, that's going to make things a little difficult.
And uh…
…OK. Corneo took YUFFIE from us.
And without YUFFIE, there's no way we'll get our Materia back.
…All right. Corneo stole YUFFIE from us as well.
And without her, there's no way we'll get our Materia back.
That's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with YUFFIE too!
And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our Materia!
Don't misunderstand.
We have no intention of joining you. We're only agreeing not to fight each other…for now.
That's fine. We have no intention of cooperating with you, either.
Now, uh, which direction did Corneo run off?
The same goes for us. We don't want to make friends with the Turks.
Now, which direction did Corneo run off?
Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna work with the Turks anyway!
Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*& run off?
Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the most obvious place.
Wutai‚Main Mtn.
Godo
GOOGAH…what do you want?
Don't have…GAH…anything much but, you should be able to…GOO…rest yourselves here. GOGAH…make yourselves at home.
…YUFFIE? …Nope, never heard of her. …GOOGO…
…You again? I said it once, and I'll say it again, I don't know her.
Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named YUFFIE here in Wutai!
…Never seen you around here before…
Lately, I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here…You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
I don't care about who you are.
But, if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder.
What's with you, you coward?
YUFFIE!
You scared of the Shinra?
Then why don't you just bow down and obey them like all the other towns?
Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!
Shut up! What would you know about this?
You got beat once, so what? That's it? What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!
You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
That's my style! And it's my business, not yours! Don't try and dictate what I should do!
Style? Dictate?
Why all those fancy words? You're a rotten daughter!
Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
…Take your things and get out of here now.
For the good of Wutai, we cannot stand up to Shinra.
Now listen up! They must be in the area! Find them no matter what!
Hidden Passage
Received "Magic Shuriken"!
Received "Hairpin"!
Received "HP Absorb" Materia!
Item/Accessory Store
Hey yo! Welcome!
We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace! So strike while the iron's hot!
You aren't tired of my rambling?
Great! Then come on in and start buying!
Sorry, but we're entirely sold out now.
What's this here? Ah, no…that's uh…
…A sample! Yeah, that's it…a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?
Listen, I'm sorry about last time. YUFFIE told me not to sell anything to you.
[DOESN'T EXIST]
This is a weapon store of hard cores, by hard cores, and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?
Sorry, listen I… No, nothing…never mind.
Stole "MP Absorb" Materia!
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?
You're an odd one…
I'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no Materia left anywhere in Wutai.
Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides…
If we had a lot of Materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't…
And now it's too late to be worrying about Materia at this stage of the game…
If you see anything you need, buy it.
Huh? What? You DID?
Oh, no, no, no! I'm just replacing these goods! You come back later.
YUFFIE's House
I know, the Materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. …Follow me.
…I've been hearing that ever since I was little.
Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more impressive.
You see what it looks like now, right? …Just a tourist trap…
After the war, we got peace, but we lost something else. Now look at Wutai…
That's why… if I had lots of Materia I could…
Listen, YUFFIE. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.
You've got our Materia and I want it back…now.
If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
I'm sorry, YUFFIE. I know how you feel, but we need Materia, too.
…We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
Dammit, YUFFIE. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.
If you want Materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.
I know. I know that…
That…sniff…switch… the lever on the left…… Materia's…sniff, hic…in there.
Don't make a mistake. The left lever…
I'm sorry, but……
Ain't nuthin' we can do about it…
Now, the Materia…
Were we a little too harsh on her?
Well, let's get our Materia back.
Hmmph… I dunno.
There was nothing else to do.
Wh…what the hell is this?
Wh, what are you doing?
Wh, what is this?
Whoa!
!?
Ha, ha--! You should've listened!!
Ha, ha, ha--! Never trust anyone that easily!!
The Materia's mine! Tough!
You want your Materia? Then go find it yourself!
Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the Materia, remember you gotta steel it.
Heh heh… Steel…steel! Get it?
C'ya!!
Y, yo, wait up!!
Wait, don't leave us!
W..wait, don't leave us here!
Help us first!
Hey, help us…please!
Hey! Help me first!
Wait, don't go by yourself!
Flip the Left Lever

Drink at the "Turtle's Paradise" and talk about Wutai! To find "Turtle's Paradise", look for the big pot outside!!
Hidden Room
Let go! I SAID let GO!
Hey! Who do you think I… OW! What're you doin'? Jerk!
You!
Oh! You're…
Ww, who are you!?
…ho… …ho…
Hohi, hohi! Hohihi!
Corneo!?
Don Corneo!?
The hell are you doing!
I've finally got a new chicky!
Two for one, in fact! Heh, heh!
Two!?
Two!?
H…hey! Let go of me! You're gonna regret this!!
Received "Swift Bolt"!
There he is! It's Corneo! Don't let him get away!
Attaaaack!
Num, num…
Help me. Help me. Help me…
Num, num… I hope Meteor doesn't fall anywhere around here…
Oh, Great Da-chao… Please grant us your strength…
He's in the pagoda next to Lord Godo. Lord Godo says we're stuck…
Wutai‚Da-chao Statue
Wutai‚Godo's Pagoda
You're finally here. We're gonna split up.
You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.
Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, YUFFIE.
For now…
Stop fooling around. The enemy's not gonna wait for us, you know!
You all thought they might be here too, huh?  We were way off.
There's no way they could get this far.
Can't go through here… That flame would fry me in an instant.
Eyaaaah!
There is no way past this!
Damn, that's hot!
I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!
"The Scale of the Sea God" shines!
LET…ME……GO!!!!
Hmm! Delicious…scrumptious! I think I've just found a new HOBBY!
Which shall it be? Hmm…Hmm…
He…hey, I'm a 'Turk'! Don't think you can get away with this!!
Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken those rope lessons more seriously!!
Hmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will be…
GROSS-NESS!
Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
Oooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!
All right, that's it!!
Hold it right there!
Hey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!
Oh man! CLOUD……!
Oh man! TIFA……!
Oh man! That old fart, CID!
Wheeel…long time no see.
Don't tell me you forgot…
That fall into the trap really hurt!
You just don't get it, do you…!?
Hmm…Who are you guys!?
Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!
 You damn Midgar hyena…!
Hurry and let the two go!
I don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it…
Listen you stupid, slimy, sleazy old scab bag! If you want to get women, there's such a thing as the RIGHT way!
Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then…
It's a long story, but……
We don't want to hear it! Just let them go!
I don't really give a damn! You're gonna let them go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!
I don't really care! Let YUFFIE and Elena go!
Hmm…You guys are serious. …Good, good.
Why did you kill my little Aps?
I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't interfere in my search for a bride!
RAPPS---come here!!
Wait…
You better say your prayers!
Don't be such a poor loser, old man!
Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
Eyaaaah…
It makes me so MAD!
Once I push this button, they'll fall and we'll have SQUASHED TOMATOES!
Damn!
Coward!
So this is how a loser lives!
Damn tricky $#%@&T$*^%$ !
All right…
Grrrrrgh…
You sure are vulgar!
……!
Now, give me your women too!
Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I have the last laugh!
No, that would be us.
…The Turks!
You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.
We're going to take care of you… personally.
DAMMIT! Then they're all comin' with me!
Ugh…!
Good timing, Rude.
…Let's get to work.
All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.
Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you…?
Two…Number two?
All wrong.
No! Wait, st…
Aaaaaaaaaa……p
The correct answer was…
…because it's our job.
Oh, thank you very much…!
I never thought you'd come…
Elena, don't act so weak.
You're a Turk!
Y…Yes, sir!
Th…Thanks.
Thanks for your help.
I uh, thanks for today.
Never thought you'd ever help us…
You guys have some good in you.
It would appear thanks are in order…
I'll just say you…helped.
Yes…this is Reno.
Yes…Yes… I'll get on it right away.
Was that the company?
Yeah, they want us to find CLOUD…
Are we on?
No, today's our day off.
Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
Freeze!
You aren't from Wutai, are you?
Only those from Wutai may enter the tower!
I'll have to ask for you to leave!
Hey! I can't stand liars! Leave this tower at once!
Oh, Miss YUFFIE! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
Yeah
No way!
Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!
Miss YUFFIE! You cannot go on to the second floor unless you defeat me!
Yo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
Gorky
Then, begin!
Power Change!
Here I am, Miss YUFFIE!
Shake
Hmm, I thought you were just a girl, but you handled that pretty good!
Let's see how you do on next one…
In my opinion, you need more training! Gorky is disappointed!
No good! You have to beat Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
Of course!
Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Who's next?
Are you blind? I'm right here!
What? I gotta fight a punk?
Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
Wh, what did you say!?
See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!
Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
Now watch…!
'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Are you sure you wanna fight?
Stop yappin'!
I'll forgive you
Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky.
I guess it's Chekhov's turn…
Here I go, brat! Speed Change!
URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
HYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
You don't belong here! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts!
Hey, you there! Don't ignore me!
So you're just talk after all. Brat!
Chekhov
You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
Ho, ho, ho… It's been a while since I felt pain…
So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, eh Chekhov?
Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes.  Staniv, you watch over there.
That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.
I got insurance.
Let's get this over, ya' old geez.
Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic…
Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?
Magic Change!
I can't believe…you beat me.
Staniv
This should be interesting! It's been too long since I've had a chance to use my full power…
Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature child know…?
This is the average person's limit?
That being the case, we have nothing further to discuss.
How dare they mock us, thinking they could sneak past us.
First, Chekhov will keep you company…
So you're here…
Huh? Who am I supposed to beat?
HAAAAH!
The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent… This is a five-storied pagoda,but the fourth floor is the highest…
In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!
You still want to try…?
Just come on!!
I'll pass!
I like you! Now watch…
Weapon Change!
How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all my strength into it…
Wh, what…!?
Splendid! You have definitely improved…
Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!
Of course. If WE lost to her…
You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM!
If it were not for Miss YUFFIE, I wouldn't be facing him…
You didn't seem like someone who could get to the fourth floor so easily…
D,…Dad!?
I'm glad you made it this far, YUFFIE!
Why, why are you……
I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!
Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't…then I'll have to kill you!
Dammit……
Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!
Hmm? A slight improvement.
Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change!!
H…hey!
What are you doing! OMNI-Change!!
…heave…heave…
…huff…puff…
O…old coot… not…bad…
You've…also…improved…
Hah…Ha, ha…
…Heh, heh…
Ha ha haaaaaa!
Waha haaaaa!
It's time I gave this to you, YUFFIE…
This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
…I thought I'd give it to you, but you have no room for it.
Then, come back for it later. And don't forget!
Leviathan Materia? Oh! So you DID remember.
Well it's yours, go ahead and take it!
You have too much Materia!
But, Lord Godo. Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom…
CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM… I'm so sick of hearing that!
It's so stupid!
Silence, Miss YUFFIE!
Then what 'bout all of you? With all your power…
Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
You too, Dad! Just because you lost the war,
You turned Wutai into a place like this!
What do you mean?
You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists…
How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
She IS a kid.
YUFFIE!!
Forgive me… It's all my fault…
What are you saying, Lord Godo!
Losing the war…turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault…
Lord Godo!
Silence!!
YUFFIE……
I am the same now as I was before when I wanted war.
But, after losing, I began to think…
Is strength for beating enemies
…or just something to show-off?
Might begets might.
The same as Shinra.
I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.
But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai…
And now, I realize both are necessary…
Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless…!
Lord Godo…
You there, please take YUFFIE with you!
I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!
Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' CID!
If you put it that way, we can't refuse…
As long as she doesn't interfere!
All right. We'll take her with us.
…after that, how can we refuse?
Hmm… You may come if you want to …
Jus' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia…!
All right, I don't mind.
Go, YUFFIE!
For the sake of Wutai!
Dad…
I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!
Go! And come back alive!
Duh!
YUFFIE, wait a minute.
After their battle is over…
Do you think they'll still want all their Materia?
Dad…!
Go! Fight till the end! But come back!
With the Materia!
Heh, heh…you bet!
Miss YUFFIE. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that…
Please take care of Miss YUFFIE.
Never bring shame on Wutai.
She's always like this. It'll be rougher on you.
You say there's some unusual Materia where the underground pipe is!?
But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head, you won't be able to do it.
Did that kid mature at all?
Miss YUFFIE. We pray for your success!
Oh, you there! How is Miss YUFFIE doing?
Winning Miss YUFFIE's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
Compared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies.
Managing that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
I would like to fight you, however the Five Sacred Gods can only compete with those from Wutai…
Sh…
…Hm. You can do it…
Mat-…
Take care of the Materia!!
Your Mat-…
I mean, please look after YUFFIE…!
Received "Dragoon Lance"!
Received "Oritsuru"!
Received "Leviathan" Materia!
Received "Steal As Well" Materia!
Yeah, let's get some rest
I'm all right
Well…
I could take a short nap
No time to waste
Phew, perfect. Now the Materia is back in its rightful place.
Hey…the order is all messed up.
Hey, what is this? The order of it's all messed up!
What the hell's goin' on!? The order of the Materia's all messed up!
Huh? Oh, it'll be all right…
Don't be so picky!
Anyways, that sure was close.
No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!
That Corneo guy's a real pain.
I'd rather deal with my dad than with that guy.
You know, some of those Turk guys are pretty good, huh?
At least, after all that, we got the Materia back.
Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey…
Hey!! W…Wait!
Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.
…No, forget it. Besides, they have lots of Materia anyway.
Here, look, look!
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
Come on, wait!
No matter what you think, I'm going with you!
…Next time…
