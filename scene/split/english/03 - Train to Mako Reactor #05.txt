Last train out of Sector 8 Station.
Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard.
Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM,
Huh? This is my house, so make yourselves at home.
Hey!! What's going on here?
Oops, uh, n, nothing…
Please don't make any trouble.
…mumble…grumble… (…Reactor's blown to bits… …Bad things one after another… …What a day!)
Please!! Don't bother the other passengers.
This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy…
You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?
The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums.
…Blowing up a Reactor… they sure put some thought into this one.
They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
BARRET
YO!
This ain't no private car!! So split up!!
…Hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck?
BARRET
You say sumthin' ?
BARRET
I said, 'you say sumthin'!?
BARRET
Now look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden.
What's goin' on?
DAMN!!
It..it's empty because of… g, guys like you…
YYY…YIPES!!
You…you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.
Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today.
BARRET
You work for Shinra?
Shinra Manager
I won't give in to violence… and I'm not giving you my seat either!
TIFA
BARRET!!
BARRET
&$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!
CLOUD
So, what are we gonna do now?
BARRET
@#$%! The hell you so calm? You're bustin' up my rhythm!
BARRET
Huh?  Wait a minute!
Did we make a terrorist threat?
TIFA
What are you talking about? Right about now, AVALANCHE is famous.
BARRET
Heh heh… Famous…
TIFA
Looks like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.
CLOUD
So what's our next target?
BARRET
Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!
BARRET
Alright…I'll tell ya!
Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.
It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.
TIFA
Which Shinra is very proud of.
BARRET
We can't use our fake ID's anymore…
Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines.
Arrival time at Sector 4 Station is 11:45.
TIFA
That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.
BARRET
Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.
Got it!?
CLOUD
What do we do until then?
BARRET
The hell do I care whatcha do? Just siddown an' shu'up.
CLOUD
Sorry, but I have a thing against sitting down in trains.
BARRET
@#$%! Do whatever you want!
CLOUD
What do we do after we jump?
BARRET
Yo, CLOUD!
BARRET
Yo, Mr. Know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right!
So let's hear YOUR explanation!
TIFA
I'll help, too.
BARRET
@#$%! I don't know even why you came!
TIFA
Oh, BARRET! Are you mad because I'm not paying enough attention to you?
BARRET
@#$%!!
TIFA
CLOUD, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.
TIFA
Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already…
It's all right. Come a little closer.
TIFA
That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
Type A Security Alert!!
Unidentified passengers confirmed…
A search of all cars will be conducted!
Repeat!!
Type A Security Alert!!
Unidentified passengers confirmed…

TIFA
What's happening?
BARRET
What's goin' on?!
Jessie
We're in trouble.
I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
BARRET
@#$%! Someone blew it…
BARRET
Let's go! Keep it up!
BARRET
C'mon!! Hurry your slow ass up! That's it, huh?
TIFA
Oh well…
BARRET
We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!
TIFA
We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.
Hmmm? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house.
I'm impressed.
Hm? You'd talk to me even now?
I'm really impressed. Here's a little something as a reward.
Received "Phoenix Down"!
If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?
Shinra Manager
Waaaaah!!
Don't…don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man…!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this…)

BARRET
What!?
Jessie
Ugh! I'm not sure…
BARRET
C'mon, this ain't no joke!
Biggs
Hurry!
Wedge
They're locking the door, sir!
Biggs
We'll execute it just as we planned it.
Wedge
I'm goin' first, sir! Let's switch to Plan 2!
BARRET
What do you want me to do?
Jessie
Just run!
Changing to Plan 2!
BARRET
Damn!! I guess there's no other way…
We gonna kick some ass!
BARRET
What!? That's it!?
TIFA
That didn't do anything!
BARRET
We'll jump from here!! Follow me, you 'spensive leech!!
TIFA
Phew---! Be strong!

Hey… You guys are too rowdy.
Well, just calm down.
TIFA
Yes, it's really something. It's always like this.
BARRET
Hey, yo! Jus' keep the hell outta my face!
Hyu---n!! Hyu---n!!
Does this mean that we're in a major bind?
Gosh!! You're adults, but you're acting like kids.
Please behave while you're in the train.
Huh?
The hell?
Do you want this?
Yeah…
My mistake
Wow! I won't even charge you…
What? Don't get used to it though.
Wha-t? Let me know when you need me.
Received "Hi-Potion"!
Wha-t? You sure are greedy.

Alright! We clear!?
Jessie
Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for!
But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!
BARRET
Damn, man!! Explain it right!
Jessie
You want an explanation? OK!! Let me.
Jessie
This train's security system is the old Shinra A system.
Once it identifies an illegal ID, the system automatically locks down each car.
It'll stay locked until it gets to the station, where Shinra guards will be waiting.
Jessie
But it's an old system, we can get past it.
If we move from car to car to the front, we should be able to go on as planned.
Jessie
The second detection scan should be coming up pretty soon. Let's go to the next car!
Jessie
Oh no!
Jessie
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault that we didn't clear the ID scan.
I modified the ID card for CLOUD and that's what made the sensors go off.
I did my best, but it just didn't work.
Jessie
I'll make a better one next time.
I'll head back to the hideout first and work on research and development.
CLOUD
…Oh, man…
BARRET
The hell!? So this is as far as we go?
TIFA
We were almost there.
BARRET
We're gonna jump off here!! Follow me!!
TIFA
Don't worry! Don't worry!

Shu'up!!  Don't talk to me! You're gonna mess me up!
BARRET
…heave…breathe…

TIFA
Shhhhhhh! Not now!
TIFA
OK, already!
Johnny
Later…Goodbye…Adios, Midgar!!
Johnny
sob…
Hee hee!!
Yesss!!
urrrrrrrg
…Nowhere to run…
By any chance…
Busted?
Huh?
That's right
I'm SO sorry. I'll give it back…
OK, then. That's that.
Any idea what happened?
All I know is, when I woke up, the 3 of us were butt-naked!
But I guess you couldn't relate…
That scary broad made me take the bomb.
Of course I couldn't very well refuse her!
Brrrrrr…
It's terrible. Who'd expect underwear bandits in this day and age?
What the hell?
Hmph!
I know what you want to say.
Here, take it!

TIFA
…Scary…huh.
CLOUD
Too late for that now. Why'd you come along anyway?
TIFA
Because…
BARRET
Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!
TIFA
Yeah!! I've made up my mind!
Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!
CLOUD
You don't care if I go first?
BARRET
A leader always stays till the end.
Don't worry 'bout me, just go!
BARRET
Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!
It's only the beginnin' of the mission!
Wedge
Guess who? It's me, Wedge!
Looks like things were a success.
Wedge
I look just like my little brother in these clothes…
I wonder how everyone is now?
Jessie
It's me, Jessie. How do I look, CLOUD?
Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?
Yeah…
Not now
CLOUD
…You look great, just like a man.
CLOUD
Just concentrate on our plan.
Jessie
Yay!! I'm so happy …I think?
Jessie
You're right, sorry.
Biggs
I always wanted to dress up like this.
BARRET
Yo!! Ain't no time to waste!!
…Do something!
BARRET
Later! You take care of the rest!

CLOUD
Those light beams are the Shinra's security sensors. We can't go any further.
CLOUD
Shinra security guards are there. …We've got to turn back.
A terrorist attack!
AVALANCHE is attacking!
Intruders!
More security's coming. It's dangerous to stay here.
Run
Stay here
BARRET
That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!
Yo, CLOUD, what're we gonna do?
Look inside
Go down
Don't go
BARRET
Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.
CLOUD, you jus' gotta go.
Go down
Don't go
BARRET
But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills.
BARRET
Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
TIFA
…Doesn't seem to be anything that'll get us stuck in this duct.
CLOUD
After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by a security sensor.
CLOUD
Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back.
BARRET
Good, so far everything's going as planned.
BARRET
That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught…
BARRET
Oh man…… We were forced to get this far out.
BARRET
Don't let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.
BARRET
They probably don't know we sneaked in yet. We'll be at the reactor in no time.
BARRET
We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.
BARRET
Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.
BARRET
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!
Jessie
I'm sorry.
Wedge
CLOUD, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.
Biggs
We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.
CLOUD, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!
Jessie
Next time, I'll give you something better.
I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it.
Jessie
The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.
Jessie
I modified your ID card… And that's what did it…
Jessie
I did my best… But I failed.
BARRET
The reactor's just down this tunnel!
TIFA
Papa…
TIFA
Sephiroth!?
TIFA
Did Sephiroth do this to you?
TIFA
Sephiroth…SOLDIER… Mako Reactors…Shinra…
TIFA
I hate them all!
BARRET
Damn man, get a hold of yourself!
TIFA
You all right?
CLOUD
…TIFA.
TIFA
Mmm?
CLOUD
No…forget… Come on, let's hurry!
CLOUD
I know. You're my chaperone, right?
BARRET
Damn straight.
BARRET
TIFA's old friend… That ain't good enough.
TIFA
Let's hurry, CLOUD.
BARRET
Alright, let's go.

TIFA
No good. Let's try it again.
No.5 Reactor
BARRET
This way!
BARRET
Shinra soldiers!?
No.5 Reactor
BARRET
$#%&! What the hell's goin' on?
CLOUD
…A trap…
BARRET
Pres…President Shinra?
TIFA
Why is the President here?
President Shinra
Hmm… So you all must be… What was it?
BARRET
AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! So you're President Shinra, huh?
CLOUD
Long time no see, sir.
President Shinra
…Long time no see? Oh…you.
You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes…
Tell me, traitor… what was your name?
CLOUD
CLOUD.
President Shinra
Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember everyone's name.
Unless you become another Sephiroth.
President Shinra
Aah, Sephiroth… He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant.
CLOUD
Sephiroth?
BARRET
Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
President Shinra
And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you…
BARRET
VERMIN!? That's all you can say? VERMIN!?
Shinra're the VERMIN for killing the Planet! Guess that'd make you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!
President Shinra
…You are beginning to bore me.
I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me… I have a dinner I must attend.
BARRET
Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
President Shinra
But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all.
TIFA
What's that noise?!
BARRET
The hell is that!?
President Shinra
Now then, if you'll excuse me.
CLOUD
Wait, President!
President Shinra
Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him.
I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments.
TIFA
Help, CLOUD!
TIFA
THIS is from SOLDIER?
BARRET
Yo, CLOUD! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!
CLOUD
No way! It's just a machine.
BARRET
I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!
BARRET
It's gonna blow! Let's go, TIFA!
TIFA
BARRET! Can't you do something?
BARRET
Not a damn thing.
TIFA
CLOUD! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!
CLOUD
I know, TIFA…
BARRET
Hey, you gonna be alright?
(Be strong)
(I don't know if I can hold on)
CLOUD
…
You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of TIFA!
BARRET
…Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
CLOUD
Stop talkin' like this is the end!
BARRET
OK, hold on!
BARRET
Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it on your own.
CLOUD
BARRET…
CLOUD
&#%^! Can't hold on much longer.> BARRET, hurry!
CLOUD
…Techno-soldier?
