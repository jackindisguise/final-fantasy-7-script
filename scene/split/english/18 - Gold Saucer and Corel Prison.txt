Welcome to the Gold Saucer.
Are you together? A single pass is 3000 gil, or you can purchase a lifetime pass for 30000 gil.
Pay 3000 gil
Pay 30000 gil
Don't pay
Thank you very much.
If you leave Gold Saucer, your tickets become invalid.
If you have a Gold Ticket, you can come and go freely into the park…as long as you don't lose it.
I'm sorry, you don't have enough money.
Please enjoy yourselves.
Please buy your ticket here.
Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must pay with GP.
Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold Saucer.
GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the Chocobo Races.
Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful.
Would you like to change gil into GP? 1 GP is 100 gil.
Yeah

Hey, thanks 1 GP is 100 gil.
Hey, you don't have enough.
No, no. It's suspicious if you have more than 10000 GP.
If you want some more later, I'll be around now and then.

I'm sorry, I'm gonna close this for awhile.
I'm just debating if I should be in business at a time like this.
Dio
I thought about it, but there was only one solution.
I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this.

Welcome. This attraction is 3 GP.  
Shall you be riding this evening?
Yes, I shall
No, I shan't
Um, I'm very sorry, but you do not have enough GP.
Would this be your first time riding with us?
Yes, it would
No, it would not
You will be able to see all of Gold Saucer park on this ride. So please just sit back and enjoy a lovely view you won't see anywhere else.
Is that right?
This attraction can only accommodate 2 passengers, so one of you please wait over there.
Enjoy the sights of Gold Saucer.
Sorry but there's no show now.
We put on a really unusual show here. But not today, so come back again sometime and see it.
What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?
Geez, what a jerk. Why don't you just leave us alone?
Hey, I finally got 5000 points.
Hey, I got 5000 points again.

Man, I finally got a prize…
Well, I guess I'll go and get some more GP.
First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess on the attacks… …mumble, mumble…
We have to be careful of these steps.
What? A lot of things…
Yaaay!!
Eyyaaaaaa!
Come on now, no running.
Now, now, be careful of Meteor.

How is it? You having fun?
Mmm, so, you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy.
My name's CLOUD. And stop calling me boy.
Dio
Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio.
Just call me 'Dio'.
(He's not even listening)
Dio
By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?
Yeah, I know
What is it?
Dio
Ha ha ha…that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not good to lie. You can't fool me.
Dio
Oh, so you do know?
Why d'you ask me?
Dio
Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had Black Materia.'
Dio
I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age.
Did he happen to have…a black cape?
Dio
Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.
Where did he go!?
Dio
Ha ha ha, I have no idea.
Dio
Well then.
Dio
I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy.
You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display there.

This attraction is the Shooting Coaster.
While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things are going PHEW PHEW and you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, isn't it?
Oh, to shoot, hit [OK]. The bar on the left side of the screen is your Power Meter.
When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll only go …brm…and putter out. So be careful.
If you make it to the Top 3, you'll get on the Wall of Fame.
It's currently under repair…

Whenever you come to the Gold Saucer, I recommend you visit the owner's museum at least once.
Crap! I still don't have enough points.
Hmm…
So, uh, how've things been since then?
No sweat
They're going
Hmm, pretty good.
Ha ha ha! Well, good luck.
Mmm? You're new here, aren't you? Then, you want an explanation of the Battle Arena?
Yeah
Not interested
What, you too? With the way things are in the world, It makes you wonder what we're doin' here?
Well, it's a little late for me to run around now, so I do what I love, it works best for me.
Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate.
But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.'
But, there's gotta be a way to measure this, too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength.
You fight here and collect battle points. You can then exchange those points for prizes.
The Battle Game…even though it's a game you still use all your physical abilities. To participate, go to the front and pay yer GP's.
You can fight in up to eight battles. The more you win, the more battle points you get.
But, if you lose, you lose all your points So it's up to you whether or not to fight after each win.
They also make it harder by givin' out handicaps.
They decide what handicaps there'll be, and you won't know what you're up against until the battle.
Oh yeah, once you leave the Battle area, all your battle points will become useless. So watch it.
Oh, and one more thing. The maximum points you could get is 65000, no more. So if you get that many you should exchange them for something.
Sir, that entrance is for the challengers who have already registered. Please register here.
Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You can't enter there until you register.
I'm sorry to announce that our prizes have changed. Your previous battle points are no longer valid.
Welcome. You currently have battle points.
Would you like to exchange them?
Yeah
No, thanks
Thank you very much. Please remember, your battle points become invalid once you leave the Battle Arena.
Man, I knew I should've stopped. But it's so hard to stop…
Maybe I could've made it a little further. It's so hard to know when to stop…
All right, it should be my turn comin' up here soon.
I'm not going to lose this time!
I'll give that Meteor my ultra kick… …or…maybe not.
Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened!
Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.
The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived.
Those two over there eloped, saying something about Our last moments together---' I can't bear it.
I don't have anyone special in my life but when it happens, it happens.
…that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that…
Dyne…
You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong.
Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?
Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match…
How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?
Let's do it

Welcome to Chocobo Racing.
I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only.
Go---!! Do it----!! That's it----!!
I…I lost…
Yeahh! This is why I can't seem to quit.
You can only buy up to 3 tickets Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes.
Boxes?
Not interested
A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 Chocobos.
For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1 - 3, 1 - 5, 3 - 5.
You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo.
Limited wheel?
Not interested
Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.
For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1 - 2, 1 - 3, 1 - 4.
No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to skill and luck.
Hey, see that Chocobo on the odds sheet?
That's how you can find out about a Chocobo's condition.
Hmm… If you find out which are the strongest, then it's easy, right?
Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength, but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.
If these are bad, the Chocobo may use too much stamina.
One usually buys tickets for the B and C rank races, right?
Rank?
Not interested
Oh, that's right.
In other words, the 'rank' is the Chocobo's 'strength'.  A is highest and C the lowest.
You can buy A rank tickets if you become a freelance Chocobo jockey.
Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey!?
How DO you become one?
Not interested
You can become one if you own a Chocobo …and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.
What?
What?
Sir, you can't do that!
Ticket Office
Welcome Please purchase your Chocobo tickets here.
If your ticket is a winner, you will receive an item ticket good for items on the panel.
Your item ticket may be exchanged for an item or GP at the exchange counter to the right of the entrance.
Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?
Yeah
Explain it to me

Registration fees are 200 gil. Is that all right?

You can exchange your tickets for items or GP at the Exchange Counter to the right of the entrance.
You are allowed a maximum of 3 bets per Chocobo ticket.

Do you want to ride?

Hey, long time no see… How have you been?
Ester
There's a lot going on in the world outside.
It's little lonely around here, but you can't keep a jockey from doing what he loves.
Ester
How 'bout it, you want to ride again? You have your own Chocobo, right?
Ester
Yeahh, but jockeys can't buy tickets.
If you win, you'll get an item ticket, so try it!
Let me register
Tell me how to ride it
Don't do it
Ester
Hmm, it seems that no Chocobos can be registered…
Which one?
Ester
Congratulations! You're first!
Ester
And your Chocobo moved up a rank.
Ester
From the next race, that Chocobo will be in B rank.
Ester
From the next race, that Chocobo will be in A rank.
Ester
Wow! From the next race, that Chocobo will be in S rank.
Ester
Wow, that's great.
Looks like you don't have any rivals in the A rank anymore.
But you know, there's a rank that's full of those Chocobos.
Ahem!! From the next race, that Chocobo is…
S rank! Joe's usually in that group, too. So good luck.
Ester
Amazing…
This is the winningest jockey in S rank ever since Joe.
Good job. Here's a little something from me!
Received "Exp Plus" Materia!!
Never mind

I'll register this C rank Chocobo.

Then I'll register this B rank Chocobo.
Ester
Then I'll register this A rank Chocobo.
Ester
Then I'll register this S rank Chocobo.
Yeah
I changed my mind, don't do it
Ester
Which do you want, the long course or the short one?

Ester
Good Luck! Take care!
Hey, CLOUD. Let me ride once in a while.
Hey, CLOUD. Let me hop on sometime.
Sure
Nope
Ester
Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem!
First use [ASSIST] to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.
This lets you control the Chocobo yourself or let it run on its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
Then, you're stuck…
But, most of the Chocobos I have are mellow and you should be able to handle them.
When you're riding, use [SWITCH] to Speed Up and [CANCEL]to Slow Down.
If you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it will quickly lose its stamina.
Use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use [OK] to get a boost of speed.
But this makes your stamina run out faster.
Some Chocobos are bad-tempered and can't pace themselves. They'll lose their stamina quickly.
Those Chocobos should be set on Manual to slow them down.
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,
Push [START] to end the race.

But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how to fly. 
Even though Mog trains hard everyday, he still can't seem to get off the ground.  
Looks like he's still got a long way to go…
Here's where you come in.
Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing [OK] and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.
But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat.
[OK]…Give him a Kupo nut 
Oh?
It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.
All right, Mog, fly! Your future happiness may depend on it.
Unfortunately, he didn't make it.
Poor Mog'll have to wait some time for a bride.
CONTINUE
PUSH [START]
Oh-oh, seems like you don't have enough Gil. Poor Mog, looks like he'll continue be lonely for a while.
Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while. 
He did it!  He's flying! Now, he's finally become a full-fledged Mog. 
Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Goodnight, and sweet dreams…
Oh? What's this? Here comes a female Mog! 
It seems like he likes her. 
Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her?
Help him out with a few Kupo nuts. 
He's flying!! Mog was able to do it! She must have fallen for his graceful flying form.
Sometime later… Looks like things are going well with his new Mog-friend. 
Time for a quiet date in the forest.
Her name is Mag.
She is a good-natured Mog. 
Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag.
May you have lots and lots of healthy Mogs! 
Uh…no worries there, I guess… 
~FIN~
Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?
How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A happy future!
Oh, but don't hold it against me if it doesn't come true!
Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's…
You can only read the future?
You kidding? I can find missing things, missing people, anything!
Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?
Sephiroth, right!?
Okay, here goes!!
…Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune.
Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen after summer.  …Wait…hold on…
Huh? Let me try again.
Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is…blue?
…Forget it.
Wait, wait give me another chance!
What the?
What does it say?
What?
Read it out loud, CLOUD
What is it? Tell us!
What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear.
I don't know if it's good or bad…
This's the first time I ever got something like THIS.
Then shall we?
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
To where?
Huh?
Being a fortune teller, this is gonna bug me.
If I don't see how it turns out, I'll never be able to relax. So, I'm going with you!
Is it all right, CLOUD?
What are we going to do, CLOUD?
CLOUD, it's all right with you?
He's weird! CLOUD, don't let him come!
I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!
H…hey!
Yaaay!!
Eaayyyyyyh!
Come now, no running!
Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have some fun!
Now, be careful of Meteor.
Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have a blast!
I'll hang in there, even if I'm alone!
Wonder Square
They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'.
They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square games or at the Chocobo Races.
Attention! Dismissed!!
Shinra soldiers… Even here…
What happened?
What?
What happened?
What is it?
Sh…!
I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again.
…
!!
Hmm!?
Dead…
What!?
What!? Why?
What the…
Wh…why?
Wa…wait CLOUD!
CLOUD!? Where are you going?
Hey, CLOUD!
Don't, don't just leave me!
Battle Square
I heard that this is the curator's favorite attraction. He even has his collection displayed in the arena.
Yeee-----ah!!
Ea…ggha…!
No running, you kids!
Be careful of the Meteor.
Are you here for the battle, too?
That's the idea
Not interested
Is that so.
I like fighters, but hate ones who're all talk.
I watched you win eight battles. I want you to have this!
Received "Sprint Shoes"!
Good luck in the future too!
Did Sephiroth do this!?
No…it's not him… They're all shot… Sephiroth would never use a gun…
Ugh, ugggh.
Hey, what happened!
Victim
Ugh…ugh…a man with a gun…on his arm…
It can't be!?
A gun on his arm!?
…did he!?
Wow, no way!!
Hold it right there! And stay quiet!!
Dio
Did you guys do this!?
N…no, it wasn't us!
Dio
I must've been wrong…
Dio
Stop them!!
Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly.
He…hey!
Arena Lobby
Dio
That's as far as you go.
Wait, listen to…
CLOUD…
Arena
doing it.
Dio
One more to go.
Yes
Hey! Pay attention!!
Dio
I don't need to hear it. Pay for your crime below!!
Dio
Do it!
Corel Prison
Wo-ho! Welcome to Corel Prison.
Hold---it. If you wanna pass, you're gonna need the boss's permission.
…
You all right?
CLOUD, you all right?
Are you all right?
Hey, you okay?
Where are we?
A desert prison… Corel Prison…
A desert prison?
Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert… surrounded entirely by quicksand.
I heard that once you get in, you never get out…
But, there was one special exception…
Hey!! BARRET!!
BARRET!?
Mmm!? Isn't that BARRET?
Hey? Isn't that BARRET?
BARRET…
Did you…
Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with.
Jus' leave me alone…
Whew! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous…
BARRET…
CLOUD, what should we do? BARRET's not his normal self.
…BARRET…
Hey, CLOUD! Just leave him alone.
I mean, he told us to, didn't he? Then that's that, right?
This one's been shot, too…
We should find BARRET before we go out into the desert.
Basement
Empty…
Corel Prison
You new? Then go and pay your respects to Mr. Coates.
Mr. Coates' Henchmen
More respects again? You sure are formal, go ahead…
I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely dangerous.
It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave, it'll swallow ya.
I hear some of them never make it out… the best thing is to stay out of the desert entirely.
Ha ha ha
This elevator will take you to the top…
But, you gotta be picked as a Chocobo Racer, first.
Want to enter the Chocobo Race?
Not interested
Yeah, I want to enter
You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life!
Then go get permission with the boss of this place.
Who's the boss?
You don't even know that? Oh man.
Empty…
This place is heaven.
Man with a gun on his arm?
Never heard of him.
You wanna see the Boss?
Go Southwest and you'll meet him.
You'll meet him.
Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk.
Don't walk.
There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. No way.
No way.
Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not one of 'em will tell you the truth. Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of 'em.
Corel Prison
If you get lost in the desert, just keep going Northeast. If you're lucky, you'll make it back here.
Man, the Boss was REALLY in a bad mood today… Or was it one of his better days?
Prison Pub
A rookie? Then you gotta buy something. Yup, that's the rule here.
Container
Mr.Coates
Never seen your face 'round here before. Goin' up?
Not interested
Yeah, up
Mr.Coates
Heh heh! You sure got guts!
Mr.Coates
You don't seem to understand how things work down here. This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya scrubs.
Mr.Coates
The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race.
Mr.Coates
But, it's not as easy as you rookies think.
Of course, if you got the boss's permission it'd be a different story, but YOU'll never get that!
Mr.Coates
Ha ha ha ha.
Mayor's Old House
BARRET!
Didn't I tell you not to come here!?
Ju…just hold on for a second! We just want to talk! You'll understand if you just hear us out!
BARRET!!
Didn't want none of ya to get involved…
Hey that's CLOUD's line! …It's too dangerous, I can't let you get involved…' blah, blah, blah…
Yeah. We're already involved in this.
We saw you and hurried here. BARRET, just tell us what's going on.
We saw you and hurried here. So come on BARRET, just tell us what's going on.
You guys…
I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a gun-arm…was that you?
There's another… another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago…
What the hell happened?
Dyne
What's done is done.
Dyne
Hey, BARRET! It's not over yet!
Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!
I remember…
I was on my way home from visiting
a Mako Reactor being built.
BARRET! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's Shinra soldiers!
What!!!?
Dyne
C'mon, BARRET! We gotta hurry!
BARRET! Dyne! Protect the village!
Hmp!! Old man!!
Krggh!!
Dyne
BARRET!! You stay here!!
Shu' up!!
Dyne
Watch out!!
Scarlet
Kyaa, haa, ha!!
You can shoot all day and never hit them with aim like that.
Scarlet
Kya, ha, ha!!! Looks like one hit you!!
Scarlet
Kya, ha, ha!! Stop playing around and cover me!!
Dyne!! Hang on!!
Listen to me!! You're comin' back to the village, hear!!?
Dyne
Yeah… I ain't lettin' go…
You're comin' back… Everyone's waitin' for ya…
Eleanor… and Marlene… They all waitin' on us…
Dyyyyyyne!
From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more.
…I was depressed for a while.
But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in.
Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away…
Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me.
But, his was the left arm.
…
But…Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?
Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too.
He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.
…Wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace.
An' that's why I gotta go alone.
Do whatever you want… Is that what you want to hear?
Well, I can't let you do it. We need your help to save the Planet.
BARRET, this isn't the end.
Weren't you going to save the Planet?
@#$%! TIFA, you oughtta know by now.
…That's all right. I'm not so different from you.
That's easier to understand. It's you, BARRET.
So there it is, BARRET. So I guess it'll be BARRET, me, and…
I wonder if Dyne will join us?
Be careful.
Hmm? Shall I go with you?
Fortune's good. Everything is perfect!
You all sure are acting pretty heroic, considerin' we're not makin' any money on this…
Looks like we could get some sleep here.
Sleep
Don't sleep
Corel Desert
Wanna ride?
Get on
Don't get on
Corel Desert
Corel Prison
Dyne
…Dyne …is that you?
Dyne
Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years…
Dyne
A voice I'll never forget…
I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday… I knew you were alive somewhere… we had the same operation.
Listen Dyne, I want to…
Dyne
I can hear her voice. What's that?
…?
Dyne
It's Eleanor's voice. Begging me… not to hate your rotten guts.
Dyne
That's why I never hunted you down…
…I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me.
But…what're you doin' in a place like this?
Why ya wanna kill people who ain't even involved? Why?
Dyne
Why!? The hell do you care!?
Dyne
You think the dead understand why's? Is hearin' Shinra's excuses gonna make people in Corel understand anything?
Dyne
I don't CARE about reasons!
Dyne
All they give us is artillery and stupid excuses… What's left is a world of despair and emptiness…
…
Dyne
You still want to hear 'why'? …All right, I'll tell you.
Dyne
'Cause I want to destroy everything.
Dyne
The people in this city.
Dyne
This city itself.
Dyne
The whole world!
Dyne
I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor… Marlene…
Dyne, Marlene… Marlene's still alive.
Dyne
…?
I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure.
I wandered around town for awhile…
That's when I found her… …found Marlene.
Dyne
…
She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?
Dyne
So…she's still alive?
Dyne
All right, BARRET. Then I guess you and me gotta fight.
What!?
Dyne
Eleanor's all by herself. I gotta take Marlene to her.
Dyne…are you crazy!?
Dyne
Marlene wants to see her mom, don't she?
Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!
Dyne
Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.
Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!
BARRET!
CLOUD, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!
Dyne
…BARRET…
Dyne!!
Dyne
Back!!
Dyne
…I didn't just lose an arm back then…
I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where it went wrong…
Dyne…I don't know either, man.
Is this the only way… we can resolve this?
Dyne
I told you… I… I wanna destroy everything…
Dyne
Everything… This crazy world… Even me…
An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?
Dyne
…Think about it…BARRET… How old was Marlene back then?
Dyne
Even if I did go see her… she wouldn't even know me…
Dyne
And what's more…BARRET…
Dyne
My hands are too stained to carry her anymore…
…
Dyne
BARRET…
Dyne
Give that pendant to Marlene… It was…Eleanor's… my wife's…a memento…
All right…
Dyne
…so…Marlene's… already…4…
Dyne…?
Dyne
BARRET… Don't…you… …Don't ever make her…cry…
Dyne!
Dy------ne!!
…Dyne. Me an' you were the same…
My hands ain't any cleaner… I shouldn't carry Marlene either…
Uuuurrrrrrgh!!!
Mr.Coates
You want somethin'?
I want to go up.
Mr.Coates
Like I told you before, you gotta get the boss's permission, then win the Chocobo…
Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak.
So, I got this, instead.
Mr.Coates
Yeah, bull--!!
Mr.Coates
R, right.
Mr.Coates
Did you kill Dyne?
Mr.Coates
You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing.
…So Dyne's dead… Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little.
Mr.Coates
Dyne didn't care who anyone was…
The hell do YOU know!!
Mr.Coates
R…ight! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. S…sorry.
Then, will you get us outta here?
Mr.Coates
Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken.
Mr.Coates
I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here.
Mr.Coates
That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer.
Mr.Coates
And, only one racer can go up at a time.
Say what!?
Mr.Coates
Noooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!
A rule's a rule. I can't change it.
If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I can't do that!
Mr.Coates
OK, OK, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio.
Alright then.
CLOUD, you go.
We'll wait down here.
Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!
You're right. CLOUD should do it.
Yes, good luck, CLOUD.
Right, CLOUD. We'll be waiting and rooting for you.
Well, CLOUD go get 'em!
OK CLOUD, knock 'em dead!
Mr.Coates
Have you decided?
Mr.Coates
All you need now is a manager…
To register and get a Chocobo…
Hi. I happened to hear your story.
Mr.Coates
Ester?
Ester
I'll be your manager.
Mr.Coates
Well, I have nothing against it, but…
Mr.Coates
This is Ester. She may look kinda funny…
But there's no better manager in the races…
Ester
That's so rude…
Ester
Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, CLOUD.
Mr.Coates
All right then, CLOUD.
I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details.
Ester
Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. 
You just concentrate on the race.
Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals.
Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some only for glory… And then there're people like you.
Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo.
All right
Not interested
Ester
Ummm… First use [ASSIST] to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.
This lets you control the Chocobo yourself or lets it run on its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
Then, you're stuck…
But, most of the Chocobos I have are mellow and you should be able to handle them.
When you're riding, use [SWITCH] to Speed Up and [CANCEL] to Slow Down.
But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it will quickly lose its stamina.
Use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use [OK] to get a boost of speed.
But this makes your stamina run out faster.
Some Chocobos are bad-tempered and can't pace themselves. They'll lose their stamina quickly.
Those Chocobos should be set on Manual to slow them down.
Finally, some advice for the restless. Once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,
push [START] to end the race.
Waiting Room
Man
You new?
Ester
Hi, Joe.
Joe
Hey, Ester you're looking pretty as usual.
Ester
Thanks.
Ester
Let me introduce you, CLOUD.
This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys.
Joe
Nice to meet you, CLOUD.
Joe
If you're with Ester, then…
Ester
Right! He's an up and coming jockey.
He'd only been down there a day and already he made it up here!!
What!?
Joe
Oh, I see…
Joe
So why did you get put down?
Sorry…we're not supposed to ask about the past here.
Joe
Hmm.
Joe
Pretty interesting… I have a feeling that we'll meet again.
Joe
Then, until we meet again, CLOUD.
Ester
I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a while.
Ester
I'll be right back.
……
I got nothing to say.
Don't get cocky. Skills don't matter once you get in the race…
The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the next race please proceed to the paddock.
I repeat…
Ester
CLOUD.
Ester
Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race.
Ester
This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He should do well.
Ester
So… Remember how to ride?
Uh, how was it again?
Yeah, I got it
Ester
Then, good luck.
Ester
Let's see First use [ASSIST] to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.
This lets you control the Chocobo yourself or let it run on its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
Then, you're stuck…
But, most of the Chocobos I have are mellow and you should be able to handle them.

Ester
Some Chocobos are bad-tempered and can't pace themselves. They'll lose their stamina quickly.
Those Chocobos should be set on Manual to slow them down.
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,
Push [START] to end the race.
Ester
Too bad.
Ester
You were so close.
Ester
I expected more from you.
Ester
That was a tough break.
Ester
Let me find a better Chocobo for you.  Wait here for a while, OK?
Ester
If you couldn't win with that last Chocobo…
Ester
All right, I'll go get the best Chocobo there is!
Ester
You gotta be kidding me!? There aren't any other Chocobos better than the last one!
Ester
Well, if you really want to win, just push [ASSIST] and try the 'AUTO' mode.
Ester
Congratulations!! Now you're home free!
Ester
Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you if you won.
Dio
Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must've won. I know you earned it.
I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you won, I'm granting you and your friends a full pardon, and setting you all free.
And by way of apology, I have a little gift for you to use on your journey.
Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a very busy man. Sincerely, Dio
A gift?
CLOUD, this is great!! The assistant manager just stopped by and dropped off a 'buggy'!
Now we can go over deserts' and 'rivers', no problem.
OK, CLOUD. I'll be waiting outside.
(Hmm? The letter continues…)
P.S. I recently met Sephiroth. I'll bet he's pretty popular with boys your age.
Why don't you get his autograph? He was heading toward Gongaga, south of the river.
Sephiroth…
Ester
I guess this is goodbye.
Yeah. Well, if you ever get your own Chocobo, come back again.
I'll take care of your registration and everything. I'll see you again.
Received "Ramuh" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
