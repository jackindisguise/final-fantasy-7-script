You a traveller? Hey wait, that glow in your eye… Are you in SOLDIER?
Grandma
Oh, you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?
Grandpa
His name is Zack.
It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying that he didn't want to live in the country…
He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?
Hmmm…I don't know.
Zack…
Young lady, you know him?
I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
…No, it wasn't.
Zack…
What a shock… I didn't know Zack was from this town.
You know him?
Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.
Zack… SOLDIER First Class. Same as CLOUD.
Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've never heard of him.
That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.
Missing?
I think it was five years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back.
He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else…
Hey? What's wrong?
Poor guy
(…jealous…envious…)
I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel for his parents.
Are you…jealous? Hmm?  Hmmm? Are you, CLOUD?
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
I was hoping maybe you were…
AERIS…
Let's go, CLOUD.
Do you know him?
N, no, I don't know him!
Your face tells me differently.
I told you, I don't!
That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying I'm joining SOLDIER!'.
There were a lot of guys like that back then.
You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group like that.
I really respect you…
I just got lucky
I worked hard for it
Don't be so humble!
Hard work pays off, huh.
You know…
I'm as proud of CLOUD joining SOLDIER as if it were me.
CLOUD, thanks for caring.
A reactor explosion three years ago took my husband…
Do people really need reactors to live?
Aren't there more important things in life?
You want something?
Buy weapons?
Hear a story?
Nothing in particular
Huh, did you want something?
Buy accessories?
Uh, need somethin'?
Need a room?
Oh, you here to shop?
Buy items?
This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor explosion.
The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the reactor was built. But all it brought us was sadness…
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.
One day, a huge explosion. killed many of the townspeople…
It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find the pieces it left all over town.
We voted to outlaw the use of Mako energy and live with nature, ever since the explosion.
People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors.
No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back…
…You don't have enough money. Come back when you get some.
It's 80 Gil a night.
Pay up
There's something shiny back there…
Don't do anything
Reach for it
A ruined reactor.
TIFA… What happened?
What happened to you two?
…Zack.
Zack. I don't know anything about that man.
…But That name sounds familiar…
Why?
That can't…
Have you ever met someone in SOLDIER named Zack?
I can't believe he hasn't contacted us in 10 years…! …After all, we're his parents.
It's 300 Gil a night.
Pay 300 Gil
I am a traveling salesman, going around the world.
I came because I heard that near this village was Materia strong enough to shake the earth.
Even I get homesick and want to see my family.
I have a favor to ask of you. Can you get this letter to my lovely wife?
Will you do it for me?
Take the letter
My wife lives in Kalm. I really appreciate this.
What's going on in a world about to end? Is kindness the first to vanish?
They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to get there.
Lifestream? Never heard of it.
Planet structure? …Who cares about that?
Why don't you go ask Bugenhagen of Cosmo Canyon hard questions like that?
Seems like the Shinra is planning something big to destroy Meteor…
I heard they're going to do something with all that Huge Materia they've been gathering…
After what happened with the reactor you can't trust Shinra.
…Everyone's going to die. Everything's coming to an end.
You lost? When that happens the only ones you can count on are your friends.
The first thing you gotta do is find your best friend.
This reactor's useless, but I hear there's still Huge Materia at the Corel, Fort Condor, and the Junon reactors.
Shinra's gathering all the Materia from those places… But for what?
Shinra's tried a lot of things, but it's only HUMAN. It's fate that Meteor will kill the people.
Tell me, young man.
Can't we be happy without having to sacrifice anything?
Can't time pass without unhappiness?
Hey, CLOUD. How did the Turks know to wait and ambush us here?
…You'd think someone told the Shinra about us?
…Is someone there?
Hey, Rude. Who do you like?
What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?
…TIFA.
Hmm…
That's a tough one.
But, poor Elena. She…you…
No, she likes Tseng.
I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient…
What are they talking about?
It's so stupid!
They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.
Ah! Oh no!
They're here! They're really here!
Hmm… Then it's time…
Rude…don't go easy on them even the girls.
…Don't worry, I'll do my job.
Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!
It's been a while.
Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.
Sector 7?
Out of our way
That's sad.
I don't like being taken for a fool.
Hey, something seems wrong, Like they knew we were coming.
…How could they know we were coming here.
I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?
Interesting… They were definitely waiting for us.
I don't like this! It's like the whole world knows where we're going.
How'd they know that we were here?
How did they know that we were here?
They followed us… But there weren't any signs of it. Then, that means…
A spy? No way.
That there's a Shinra spy…
A spy, maybe? No, no way.
…someone's been informing them.
Maybe it's someone in this group?
You don't think there's a spy, do you CLOUD?
I hate this. Now everyone's gonna blame me because I'm new.
It means there's a Shinra spy…
I don't even want to think about there being a spy…
I trust everyone.
That's as far as you go.
Man, looks like they've taken a short cut.
And a couple of Shinra dogs are here too!
The Shinra build reactors to make money. And this is what happens.
You saw that village. It's always the powerless that suffer from tyrants like Shinra.
The one's with the power control those without it. That's just the way of the world now.
But I can't let 'em do that. That's why I formed AVALANCHE to fight 'em.
…Yo, CLOUD You still gonna fight with us, right?
We need you, man.
You got it
Thanks, man.
…!!
I never shoulda believed you.
This reactor's a failure.
What I'm looking for is big, large, Huge Materia. You seen any?
…No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.
Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.
I just can't wait.
With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been getting a bigger budget.
I envy them.
But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid Heidegger even use it?
Oh…sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!
Let's go!
…Big, large, Huge Materia?
An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?
Just what are the Shinra up to?
It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development.
Hmph! This isn't any good either.
You only get junky Materia from junky reactors.
This is just part of the job. Don't take it personally.
