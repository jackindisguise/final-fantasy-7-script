Who goes there!?
C'mon newcomer. Follow me.
Biggs
Wow! You used to be in SOLDIER all right! …Not everyday ya find one in a group like AVALANCHE.
Jessie
SOLDIER? Aren't they the enemy?
Jessie
What's he doing with us in AVALANCHE?
Biggs
He WAS in SOLDIER, Jessie.
But he quit and is with us now.
Biggs
Didn't catch your name…
…CLOUD.
Biggs
CLOUD, eh? I'm…
I don't care what your names are. Once this job's over…I'm outta here.
The hell you all doin'!? I thought I told you never to move in a group!
Our target's the North Mako Reactor. We'll meet on the bridge in front of it.
Ex-SOLDIER, huh? I don't trust ya!
Press the Directional buttons while pushing [CANCEL] to run.
Wedge
I'll secure our escape passage. You concentrate on the mission, CLOUD.
Wedge
Geez, we're really gonna blow this huge furnace up? This'll be somethin' to see!
Switch On.
Jessie
Push that button over there!
Now let's go into the reactor! From here on out, you stick with me.
Leave this to me!
Don't mess up SOLDIER-boy!
Bring BARRET back alive!
Yo! This your first time in a reactor?
No. After all, I did work for Shinra, y'know.
The Planet's full of Mako energy. People here use it everyday.
However, nobody knows the truth about Mako. Do you know?
It's the life blood of this Planet. But Shinra keeps suckin' the blood out with these weird machines.
I'm not here for a lecture. Let's just do it.
@#&^%$!
From now on you come with me.
Little by little the reactors'll drain out all the life. Then that'll be that.
The planet's dyin', CLOUD!
It's not my problem.
The only thing I care about is finishin' this job before security and the Roboguards come.
…
Jessie
Code deciphered
Biggs
Code deciphered
Can't decipher code without Biggs
Can't decipher code without Jessie
You all right?
Jessie
My leg got stuck.
Jessie
Thanks!
Biggs
I only let my guard down for a minute… And someone got behind me…
Jessie
Biggs and I got the code for this door.
Biggs
Think how many of our people risked their lives, just for this code…
Jessie
Push [OK] in front of a ladder to grab on to it. Then use the [Directional button] to climb up and down.
Jessie
There you go!
Biggs
Let's go!
Jessie
Alright, be careful.
Biggs
Jessie still isn't back yet!
When we blow this place, this ain't gonna be nothin' more than a hunka junk.
CLOUD, you set the bomb.
Shouldn't you do it?
Jus' do it! I gotta watch to make sure you don't pull nothin'.
Fine, be my guest.
Watch out!
This isn't just a reactor!!
What's wrong?
Huh?
What's wrong, CLOUD? Hurry it up!
…Yeah, sorry.
Heads up, here they come!
The alarm!
Come on, let's get outta here!
This is… Materia…
Ten minutes to detonation!
Two minutes remaining
One minute remaining
Thirty seconds remaining
Ten seconds remaining
Five seconds remaining
Four seconds remaining
Three seconds remaining
Two seconds remaining
One second remaining
Damn man‚get a hold of yourself!
You all right?
…TIFA.
Mmm?
No…forget… Come on‚let's hurry!
CLOUD
I know. You're my chaperon‚ right?
BARRET
Damn straight.
BARRET
TIFA's old friend… That ain't good enough.
Let's hurry‚CLOUD.
Biggs
That should keep the planet going… at least a little longer.
Wedge
Yeah.
…
Jessie
OK! Now everyone get back.
Sector 8
Alright, now let's get out of here.
Rendezvous at Sector 8 station! Split up and get on the train!
H, hey!
If it's about your money, wait 'til we get back.
Sector 8
Flower girl
Excuse me.
Flower girl
What happened?
You'd better get out of here
Nothing…hey…
Flower girl
Really? I don't know what's going on, but all right.
…
Don't see many flowers around here
Never mind
Flower girl
What! Tell me!
Flower girl
Oh, these? Do you like them? They're only one gil.
Buy one
Forget it
Flower girl
Uh, excuse me, would you like to buy some flowers? They're only one gil.
Flower girl
Oh, thank you!
Flower girl
Here you are!
Flower girl
Ahh…not again.
What an explosion!
Think it's another Mako reactor accident?
Sector 8
Just what the hell's going on!?
Wonder what that is on the wall over there. Let's see…
Don't be fooled by Shinra!
Mako energy doesn't last forever!
Mako is the Planet's life source!
The end is in sight!
Protectors of the Planet: AVALANCHE
Received "Potion"!
Sector 8
Soldier
Hey! You there!!
Soldier
That's him!!
Soldier
Halt!!
Soldier
Over here!!
What a pain…
Soldier
That's as far as you go.
I don't have time to mess around  with you guys.
Soldier
Enough babbling… Grab him!!
Sector 8
What the?
Shinra Soldiers…
Fight them!
Later!
Hmph!
Fight them!
Later!
Wedge
CLOUD never came.
Biggs
CLOUD… Think he was killed?
No way!!
Jessie
CLOUD…
Biggs
Say, do you think CLOUD's…
going to stay on and fight for AVALANCHE!?
How the hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader?
Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups…
It's better if we don't hire a guy like that.
Wedge
Hey, BARRET! What about our money?
Uh, nothin'…sorry.
Wedge
CLOUD!!
Looks like I'm a little late.
You damn right, you're late!!
Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!
It's no big scene. Just what I always do.
(*^%!
Havin' everyone worried like that. You don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!
Hmm… You were worried about me?
Wha!?
That's comin' outta your share, hot shot! 
Wake up!
We're movin' out! Follow me!
Wedge
Hey, CLOUD!! You were great back there!
Biggs
Heh heh…CLOUD! We'll do even better next time.
Jessie
Careful, I'll shut this.
Jessie
Oh, CLOUD!! Your face is pitch-black…
Jessie
There you go!
Jessie
Say, thanks for helping me back there at the reactor!
Yeah…
That's OK
Quit thanking me
Don't mention it.
It bugs me when you thank me. It's just a part of my job.
Jessie
But, I… I was just glad…
Jessie
CLOUD……
You're right. We're just partners.
It's not ready yet… Whoa!!
Shut-off the switch in this position.
We can escape from the train event…
Did it!!

Last Train from Midgar
Inside Train
Look…you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night.
If that plate weren't there… we could see the sky.
A floating city… Pretty unsettling scenery.
Huh? Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you.
…You jus' full of surprises.
The upper world…a city on a plate…
It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza' that people underneath are sufferin'!
All the pollution from Mako energy above falls down on the world below.
And the city below is full of polluted air.
On top'a that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.
Thanks to that, the land is dying. We can't clean the air anymore.
Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?
Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe…
'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets.
I know… no one lives in the slums because they want to.
It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it.
Stop actin' like a damn kid. Siddown an' shu'up!
Jessie
Hey, CLOUD. You want to look at this with me?
It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.
To the Route Map Screen
Jessie
I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors…you know, flashy stuff.
Jessie
I know!
Next time, I'll make one just for you.
Thanks anyway
Looking forward to it
Jessie
Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal.
Jessie
Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG.
Jessie
We're almost there. After talking with you, I'm ready to try! I think you've lit my fuse!
Jessie
Speak of the devil…
That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area.
…whisper…whisper… (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.)
…We're almost back now. What a relief.
Biggs
This train hasn't switched to security mode yet.
I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.
Biggs
…YAWN…that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station.
Biggs
…snore…heebeebeeheebee…snore… (Don't act so damn big, BARRET…snooze…)
Wedge
Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous …and me, too!
Wedge
CLOUD!!
Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?
What do you have in mind?
Don't hold your breath
Wedge
All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick.
But, after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things.
Wedge
Oh man, that's pretty harsh. CLOUD. You really think I won't?
Wedge
I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.
Last Train from Midgar
Jessie
CLOUD! Look over here.
Jessie
Okay, it's about to start.
Jessie
This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.
It's about a 1/10000 scale.
The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.
A main pillar supports the plate in the center, and there are other support pillars built in each section…
Psst…whisper…whisper… (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)
Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor. The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.
Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.
Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's how things turned out.
Jessie
Phew, look what's next! Look!
Jessie
This is the route this train is on. The route spirals around the main pillar.
We should be coming around the center, right now.
Each checkpoint has an ID sensor device.
It checks the identities and backgrounds of each passenger on the train and is linked up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.
Whisper…whisper… (We definitely look suspicious, so we're using fake IDs.)
Sector 7 Station
Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!
This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.
The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion!
Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!
Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
Yo, CLOUD! You lissen up!
Yo! What're ya doin' now?
Biggs
uh, BARRET… We, uh…
Wedge
We can't do it. We just can't do it.
Jessie
Don't worry! Don't get all worried!
Jessie
CLOUD! Let's make the mission work!
Jessie
CLOUD? When this mission's over…
Why don't all of us take a long vacation. Maybe we could go to a hot springs somewhere?
Yeah…
I don't know…
Yeah… If I feel like it.
Jessie
Alrighty then! It's a date!
You never know what lies ahead.
Jessie
…how lovely.
I might just have to tempt you, then.
Yo, you all done flappin' your gums!?
Go! Get on that train!
CLOUD… Don't be so distant.
Everyone wants to be your friend. I'm sure…
Damn, man!! I'm here to fight!
Don't care 'bout bein' nobody's friend.
Let's go! Don't be late!
My husband never came back.
I wonder if something happened to him?
No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled.
I went to the station everyday.
Then, one day…
You used to see that kind of thing a lot during the war.
Please take AERIS somewhere safe.
That's the last thing she said before she died.
My husband never came back, and I had no child.
I think I must have been very lonesome.
So I took AERIS home with me.
I'm not letting you go tonight.
Wow!
Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?
There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too!
…damn.
What?
Hey, come over here.
But people will…
Who cares?
But… There's a weirdo over there.
Huh?
Say, you're pretty gutsy.
Why don't you go snoop somewhere else, Romeo?
I've had it!
Me too.
You know this is the first time we've ever agreed on something.
Yes…
Well then, shall we?
urggh…
…huff…wheez
When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.
People meeting, parting, joy, sadness… After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.
I wonder how long it's been… There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.
I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.
That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.
Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.
But, that's a story for another day…
First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.
Morning. Dawn comes and things never change.
You be careful not to get hurt. Come on back again, hear?
ALL ABOARD! The train is about to depart.
I heard a rumor that the plate was going to fall, crushing this station, I've worked at so many years.
But I just can't bear to leave here.
Sector 7 Slums
Don't get all slaphappy just 'cause today's mission went well!!
Yo, CLOUD! Over here, now!
Sector 7 Mechanized Tower
Sector 7 Slums
All right!! You losers go on ahead!!
OK! Go on ahead.
Heh heh…
You wanna meet your little baby?
Little baby?
Out of my way!
Heh! Jus' calm down.
Can't have people suspectin' us.
Hey! Don't act like you don't know what I mean!
I'm tellin' you…
You! CLOUD!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!!
The hell're you doin', boy? The operation's already started!!
I'm not opening up. Go away!!
Oh &$#&@!! What the hell's wrong tonight!!
I thought that long blackout was strange.
They say a Mako Reactor was destroyed above.
I was jes sittin' here drinkin', watchin' the news by myself. n' all of a sudden I get kicked outta the &*%$ store. What's up with that!?
Woo…ah geez, I'm blitzed. I jes love them homemade cocktails. But they sure do creep up on ya.
Did you hear?
Don't care
No, what?
There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor!!
You know what this means?
Don't care
No, what?
Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me…
if you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out, too.
Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage.
An' that ain't all!! A lotta innocent people got killed, too!
If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.
This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit.
Oh, well excuse ME!
Explosions! Explosions! Oh Man! AVALANCHE is so cool!
Hey!! Heh heh heh… Say, you're kinda cute. Cutie pie…
I wasn't even done with my drink. I didn't even pay my bill…
All's quiet!! Shh, I'm spying now!
OH!! There's something!! DANGER!!  ALERT!!
Did you hear?
Bout what?
Don't care
About that little girl named TIFA and that bar called '7th Heaven'.
I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop.
You wanna hear?
You bet!
Don't care
That BARRET and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes.
Suddenly, they throw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder.
It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there.
Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!
There's a TV in there, but my cheap aunt won't let me in the house. Look for yourself.
Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums.
But that BARRET, busted it up.
Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam.
I think it was when President Shinra was on.
He was on again this morning, too, you know.
TIFA better watch out for her TV. 
Hey!! Open up! C'mon baby!!
It's me! Johnny! Mom!!
SHHH!! Wait a minute!!
Johnny
I thought you were something a little better than this, but you're just a punk kid after all.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing with my little TIFA?
And now?
We're just friends.
What's it to you?
But TIFA doesn't think so.
Why does she ask you n' not me?
If TIFA's in trouble then I'LL help her.
But then I guess not. She's nothing to me.
Not those memories beneath the stars when we were kids or all the stuff we talked about.
About all I got is the sake that she poured me everyday I went to the bar.
Crap!
Hey! You! Don't think you can just walk outta here like that!
Shhi-! You busted a promise!! n' you made TIFA cry!!
Johnny
Oh yeah!?
That may be but you ain't walkin' away from here!
Urgh! You made a promise, didn't ya!? n' don' you fergit that TIFA like an angel. An angel of this slum!
Johnny
I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better man! This is goodbye!
Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of TIFA!
Cause, I'll be back!! Don't make her cry, dammit!!
I'll be back, I say!! n' don' fergit it!
I hope he doesn't get hurt.
That worries me the most.
Ah…Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed.
I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when I'm not drinking.
Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you from outside the bar.
TIFA's childhood friend. That's a good one!
Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of getting gossip on everyone!?
Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!
I'll get a little more information that would pique even your interest. You wait and see!
H, hey!! Keep your mitts off of Marlene!!
Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!
When it comes down to it…I'm gutless. I'm still just a no-good kid.
We're closed today. Come back tomorrow.
Don't be taken in by the Shinra. Mako energy will not last forever. Mako is the life of the Planet and that life is finite. The end is coming. Saviors of the Planet:  AVALANCHE
What crappy handwriting. And look at all this graffiti!
7th Heaven
Papa!!
Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to CLOUD?
Welcome home, CLOUD. Looks like everything went well.
Did you fight with BARRET?
Yeah
Not this time
I should have known.
He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little.
I was worried.
Hmm. You've grown up. When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.
Enter name
Flowers? How nice…
You almost never see them here in the slums.
But…
A flower for me? Oh CLOUD, you shouldn't have…
…
Give it to TIFA
Give it to Marlene
Thank you, CLOUD. It smells wonderful.
Maybe I should fill the store with flowers.
Thudthudthud!!
Marlene
Papa, welcome home!
You all right, BARRET?
Great!!
Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!
Everyone is down below.
Yeah.
Huh? Where'd you get that flower?
Marlene
CLOUD gave it to me.
Oh…
Did you thank him?
Marlene
…
Marlene
Thank you, CLOUD.
We'll take care of you.
CLOUD… come over here.
Sit down.
How about… …something to drink?
I don't feel like it
Give me something hard
OHH!!
I can make a drink just as good as anyone else.
Everyone says my drinks taste the best!
Just a minute. I'll make one for you.
You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely.
What's with you all of a sudden? That job wasn't even tough.
I guess not…
You were in SOLDIER.
Make sure you get your pay from BARRET.
Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here.
CLOUD. Are you feeling all right?
…Yeah… Why?
No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.
You'd better go down below.
AVALANCHE Hideout
Yo, CLOUD! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya.
Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?
None. I'm positive.
You sound pretty sure.
If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now.
Don't go thinkin' you so bad jus' cuz you was in SOLDIER.
…
Yeah, you're strong.
Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are.
But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now! Don't get no ideas bout hangin' on to Shinra.
Stayin' with Shinra? You asked me a question and I answered it…that's all.
I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.
Wait, CLOUD!
TIFA! Let him go!
Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
Shut up!
I don't care about neither Shinra nor SOLDIER!
But don't get me wrong!
I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!
Wedge
You think I'm a little too uptight?
Yeah…
No…
The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor.
CLOUD, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?
Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it.
Well, that's OK. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart.
Wedge
…CLOUD.
You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me.
CLOUD… You just want friends.
Isn't that right?
Blow off
I really don't care
Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me.
If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me.
You're terrible. Real cold-blooded.
Jessie
Oops…
Hey, look at the news… What a blast.
Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me.
Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.
Jessie
Hey, that was my first bomb. Makes me kinda proud.
Jessie
Money…
Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it.
Sure! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out.
Oh stop it, CLOUD! Did you hear me?
President Shinra
…today the No.1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing.
It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror.
But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear.
I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night.
Marlene
Papa, you're so great!
Shucks!! …money…
Straighten things up with everyone for me.
Save Point
Access the menu and select [SAVE] to save your game.
Listen, CLOUD. I'm asking you. Please join us.
Sorry TIFA…
The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely, it's dying.
Someone has to do something.
So let BARRET and his buddies do something about it. It's got nothin' to do with me.
You damn right we'll do something about it. N' you stay outta this TIFA!
President Shinra
The terrorist group called AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for today's bombing of the No. 1 Mako Reactor. It is also predicted that they will continue with similar terrorist activities in the future.
But I want the citizens of Midgar to be assured.
Shinra, Inc. has mobilized SOLDIER to protect you from any violence and thereby…
Will you please come back? Ah, wait. Please wait.
The president of Shinra is going to read a statement.
The next time we'll be up against…SOLDIER.
CLOUD, then you'll help us?
A promise is a promise
But I still hate BARRET
I hate BARRET.
You came to tell me that?
He's not a bad person.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Come on. Let's go below!
Good Morning! CLOUD!
Did you sleep well?
BARRET's snoring kept me up….
Next to you, who wouldn't?
…psst…
(keep it down, they'll hear you. BARRET's always edgy before an operation.)
I don't know what you mean.
I'm going this time.
Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!
Marlene
All right!! Good Luck.
Marlene
Take care!
Sorry, CLOUD. Marlene seems a little shy.
Marlene
…
Biggs
Aaah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job.
Biggs
Hic!!
Why don't you have one too?
No
Yeah, why not?
Biggs
Oh!! That's more like it!!
Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!
What!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?
Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!
Biggs
Hic!!
Oh… don't tell BARRET what I jus' said.
Wedge
Oh, CLOUD!
TIFA really knows how to cook.  Mmm…
Anyway, let me tell you somethin'.
About what?
I'm not interested in your stories
TIFA always lets me taste her cooking.
And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly.
Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous.
Oh well… forget it then.
Jessie
Hey Wedge, you're getting all excited.
Stop making such a mess!
Biggs
You know, CLOUD. BARRET says those things, but…
We're really unstable right now. If SOLDIER were to show up, they'd whoop us.
Wedge
CLOUD, ya gotta help us. I'm really scared.
Jessie
CLOUD…. It's painful.
Why is that?
What's goin' on? It's really shakin' a lot…
TIFA? Where?
…I'm going out…
Received BARRET's stash, 1500 gil!
So! You're really leaving!?
You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend!?
What?
How can you say that!
…Sorry
….You forgot the promise, too.
Promise?
So you DID forget.
Remember? CLOUD, it was seven years ago…
You remember now, don't you? Our promise?
Look, the well.
Do you remember?
Yeah…back then.
I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold.
Sorry I'm late.
You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
Come this Spring…I'm leaving town for Midgar.
All the boys are leaving town.
But I'm different from them. I'm not just going to find a job.
I want to join SOLDIER.
I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth!
Sephiroth… The Great Sephiroth?
I thought about Sephiroth all the time. Even in my sleep. My mom had given up on me.
I had no idea you were planning on that.
But, what about our promise?
Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
…I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while.
…Huh?
If you make it, will you be in the newspapers?
I'll try.
Hey, let's make a promise.
Umm…if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind…
you'll come save me, all right?
What?
If I'm ever in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me.
I want to experience that at least once.
Ha, ha, ha! What's that?
You're laughing at me!
Come on! Promise me!
All right…I promise.
I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. So I can't keep our promise.
But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER.
So come on! You've got to keep your promise…
Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!
This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.
What? Then you'll…
You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.
What!?
It's OK, it's OK.
…psst…. (We're really hurting for help, right?)
Uh….ugh…. (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'….)
2000!
Thanks, CLOUD.
Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first.
I'll fill you in on the train.
Yo, CLOUD.
Got a message from the old man at the weapon shop upstairs! Said he's got somethin' special so come and get it!
Yo! If you pull somethin' funny… you now what I'll do to ya, right?
Whoa, wait a damn minute. CLOUD!!
A promise is a promise! Here!!
I'm so glad everyone's safe.
Yo! CLOUD!
Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!
I, uh… I don't really know how to use Materia!
I'll give you that Materia we found. Just teach me how to use it!
…sigh…
OK, I'll explain it
You wouldn't understand
So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?
Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia!
&$*#! What's this, It wasn't that tough!' crap?
I don't get it!….
You just handle the Materia, CLOUD!
CLOUD! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs.
He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!
[Materia System]
Access the menu and select [Materia] to equip Materia.
Sector 7 Item Store
Ahh… Another slow day…
If this keeps up, this store's goin' under…
Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this.
Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. Are you…a customer?
Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!
By the way, you wouldn't happen to be…  Naw, never mind. Forget it. Sector 7 Weapon Shop
He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!
You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'!
Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean.
Hey!! What the--YOU!?
Anyone talking to me must be a novice.
Yep, that's me
I used to be in SOLDIER,
the name's CLOUD
So what. Everyone's gotta start sometime.
The name's CLOUD. Used to be with SOLDIER, I got no business with you.
Hmmph!! Well, I never heard of ya!
Don't act so big, amateur. Seein' as how I'm such a warm hearted guy, I'll show ya the ropes.
You come back here tomorrow. I got some things I gots ta do.
Heh heh…He'll forget about it. OH, you!!
Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya.
Crap!! Watch it, you old guy!
I was just about to rip up that smooth little head of yours!
In the slums ya gotta take care of yourself first.
I been livin' like that ever since I was a kid.
You wanna be tough like me? Then you gotta pick out some good weapons.
Oh and uh, by the way old guy…
You can see this store don't have no customers… and even tough guys like me could use a buck or two…
Ya think you could spare some cash?
Give him some
Don't give him any
YESSS…
Damn, man!! Ya chinsey old %*&!
Hey old guy! I got a good-lookin' sister!!
Give him some
Forget it
What's the matter, old dude? You don't like women?
You dried up old geez. You tired?
Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house?
There's just one condition.
You gotta give me some cash.
1 gil
10 gil
nothin'
Damn, man!! Just forget about it!
Oh man, oh man…
Go ahead 'n' help yourself to the room.
Cheap %#*^…
Geez, dude, you're really old. You sure you ain't poorer than me?
Use whatever bed you want. Sleep tight, old guy.
Weapons Shop 3rd Floor
This is a slum, so don't think you can stay for free.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?
10 gil
no way
Tough guy, huh!? You'd better sleep when you can.
You'd better save when you can.
That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude.
Sweet dreams, pops.
Rough times, huh pop? Not a dime on you?
Hoo…
Save Point
Sector 7 Slums, Weapons Shop Floor 2
Beginner's Hall
Unn!! Who the hell are you!? No unauthorized access.
Do you know about what's been going on?
What, that again?
…
You must be sick of hearing it… But it's been so long since there was any real news here.
You're worried where it's all heading, right? Everyone's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor.
On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality…
they say they're just out to kill as many people as they can.
Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself.
Haaa, haaa, haaa!!
That's a good one, ain't it!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores!
Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' OK.
I welcome everything going to pot!
GO!! GO!! AVALANCHE!! That's what I say!
You know what I do? I'll bet you don't.
You come here tomorrow and I'll tell you.
Ahh, there just ain't no good jobs here in the slums.
I wanna go to the upper world.
This is the Beginner's Hall.
You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you how much I know… an' for free too!
What do you want to know?
How to save?
How to heal your allies?
Curative Magic?
Weapons and armor?
How to apply Materia?
Effective ways to use Materia?
How to form your battle party?
How to check your status?
About Limit status?
Other things to watch for?
That's all
First, you need Potions.
You're a stingy one. Here, I'll give you ONE Potion.
I don't have any extra Potions on me. Why don't you go buy some?
Sorry. I'll have to go get my money.
You probably know all this. But just in case, I'll go over it.
Until you get instructions, don't open or take discs out of the CD drive.
After you open up the CD drive, I can't guarantee what'll happen. That's all.
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "All" Materia!
[Save Point]
Received "Ether"!
Hey!! You got one right off!
That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!
Now listen, hidden in these treasure chests are a lot of items.
There are box types and bag types, so make sure you don't overlook any.
This is the fabled [Save Point]!!
At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select 'SAVE'.
You can also do something else there, but right now it's a secret.
Even if you are wiped out, if you've saved, you can restart from that same point. That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.
This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar…
and you get to the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that.
That should be all you need to know about the Save Point. I'll probably see you again somewhere down the road. Take care!
I'm a [treasure chest]!!
Beginners, make sure and keep an eye out for me!!
Hey SOLDIER!! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!
What do you want to know?
About ATB
About numbers on the screen
About [Change] and [Defend]
About [Escape]
About [Gauges]
About [Status]
About [Elementals]
About [Help]
That's all the time I have for you!
I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.
ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle.
Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle.
This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners.
Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle.
This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you!
Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like.
White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points.
You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.
The [Change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows.
In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less.
You can make a [Change] by pressing the Directional button in battle. Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [Defend].
Selecting [Defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command.
If you're up against a strong enemy, don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it.
I don't really remember ever having to use the [Escape] command… but you'll probably need it.
Push [PAGEUP] and [PAGEDOWN] together, hold them down, and you can escape.
During battle, there are several [Gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you.
[time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle.
When the gauge is full, you can make your command. If you don't want to make one, push [MENU] and you can move to the next character. It's convenient when you wanna make BARRET work.
The [limit gauge] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the [limit technique].
This gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time.
It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it.
You probably don't know about them, but there are conditions of [fury] and [sadness].
When you have [fury], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower.
Keep in mind that [sadness] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened.
The [barrier gauge] shows your defense barriers.
The top gauge displays [barrier] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays [magic barrier] or defenses against magic attacks.
Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear.
Whenever you use [barrier] or [magic barrier] make sure to pay attention to the [barrier gauge].
That's it. Remember that for the next battle.
Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head?
Well, don't worry. You just need to push [ASSIST] in battle.
Do that, and the [Help] message will walk you through the commands.
It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while. Make good use of it.
[wiped out]. This is one I've never personally used. But I heard from someone what it was about.
When you are wiped out, you start back from the last save point.
Even a weakling like you can make it out of the roughest places as long as you hang in there and fight. You should be glad!
[Status] means just that. The status of each character.
I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points.
Sleep You cannot put in a command until you get up.
Poison Steals your HP in battle.
Fury Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it.
Sadness Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it.
Petrify Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out.
Confuse Will attack enemy and ally alike.
Silence Will be unable to cast magic.
Paralyze Stops time gauges, commands.
Darkness Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases.
Frog Become a frog. I hate this one!
Hoo…I'm beat.
Your [Status] can be changed with magic and items, so you should check it whenever you buy things.
[elemental] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic.
It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time.
I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally.
Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.
Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.
Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.
Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.
Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison-based enemies.
Gravity Gravity-based attack. These hurt if they hit.
Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.
Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.
Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.
If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge!
Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true.
To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it.
……smack……knock……!!
Help!
You've got to hang in there. Your limit gauge is just starting to build.
Waaaah!!
OK! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight with your limit technique.
Magic!! Magic!!
Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic Barrier] or [reflect].
[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage received from magic by half.
[reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.
Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too !
Me too!
If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia. And you have to find the best combinations of them.
The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows.
Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless.
That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent.
I still don't get it!
Listen kids, don't piss me off!
That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll get used to it.
Great!
How to use the buttons.
[Directional button][CONTROL]
up [MENU]: menu

[How to restart]
You must quit the game in order to restart.
To quit the game, either select QUIT
in the Main Menu or press CTRL+Q.
Huh? Finger!? What the hell?
I'm the position cursor!! Call me whenever you're walking around confused!
Push [ASSIST] and I'll appear over your shiny little head.
Geez, you stand out even more than I do…
Am I in the way? If so, just push [ASSIST] one more time.
I'm pretty busy myself, and can't always come when you need me. If I don't show up sometimes, don't get mad.
Later!
[Position Cursor]
Push [ASSIST] when you're lost in the field. Usually, the [Position Cursor] will appear on the screen.
But wait!!
[Red triangles] mark the exits and [Green triangles] mark ladders.
These will help you safely make it through even the darkest streets or dangerous mountains! But, there are times when they won't appear, so be careful.
Johnny's Home
Ha, Ha!…… Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say.
Ha!  Ha!…… I wonder if my son's already left?
When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome it gets.
We want him to be happy and do other things while he's young, but we can't help but worry…
I guess we always will.
By the way……
Where are you from?
A village called Nibelheim
Who cares?
But if you still have a family, you outta at least write them.
You may leave your home, but it'll always be there for you.
At least that's how I see it.
Hmm…did you say Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back?
Something to do with a reactor accident…
That was the first major Mako accident, I remember it was all over the news.
This might sound rude, but…
Is your family still living?
I forgot about them long ago
I'm just an ex-SOLDIER
Well, you really outta go home again. And if you can't do that, try and at least remember them sometimes.
Our boy acted like you, When he was a kid.
You seem to be about his age.
Well, would you mind leaving us alone?
I want to enjoy some quiet time together with my wife.
He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was here, but now that he's gone…we kind of miss him. …Strange, isn't it?
Last train out of Sector 8 Station.
Last stop is Sector 7, Train Graveyard.
Expected time of arrival is 12:23AM,
Huh? This is my house, so make yourselves at home.
Hey!! What's going on here?
Oops, uh, n, nothing…
Please don't make any trouble.
…mumble…grumble… (…Reactor's blown to bits… …Bad things one after another… …What a day!)
Please!! Don't bother the other passengers.
This is why I hate the last train. Hoo-boy…
You see the headlines in the Shinra Times?
The terrorists that bombed the No. 1 Reactor are based somewhere in the slums.
…Blowing up a Reactor… they sure put some thought into this one.
They must have a real calculating leader. I wonder what they'll do next?
YO!
This ain't no private car!! So split up!!
…Hoodlums again. God, don't I just have all the luck?
You say sumthin' ?
I said, 'you say sumthin'!?
Now look at that!! It got empty alluva sudden.
What's goin' on?
DAMN!!
It..it's empty because of… g, guys like you…
YYY…YIPES!!
You…you've seen the news, right? AVALANCHE says there'll be more bombings.
Only devoted employees like me would go to Midgar on a day like today.
You work for Shinra?
Shinra Manager
I won't give in to violence… and I'm not giving you my seat either!
BARRET!!
&$#%!! You lucky ^$#^$.!
So, what are we gonna do now?
@#$%! The hell you so calm? You're bustin' up my rhythm!
Huh?  Wait a minute!
Did we make a terrorist threat?
What are you talking about? Right about now, AVALANCHE is famous.
Heh heh… Famous…
Looks like they just finished connecting the cars. We're finally leaving.
CLOUD
So what's our next target?
Hah! Listen to Mr. Serious-about-his-work!
Alright…I'll tell ya!
Jessie's probably already told you, but there's a security check point at the top plate.
It's an ID scan system checkin' all the trains.
Which Shinra is very proud of.
We can't use our fake ID's anymore…
Good Morning, and welcome to Midgar lines.
Arrival time at Sector 4 Station is 11:45.
That means we've got only three more minutes to the ID Check point.
Alright, in three minutes, we're jumpin' off this train.
Got it!?
What do we do until then?
The hell do I care whatcha do? Just siddown an' shu'up.
Sorry, but I have a thing against sitting down in trains.
@#$%! Do whatever you want!
What do we do after we jump?
Yo, CLOUD!
Yo, Mr. Know-it-all, big time SOLDIER! You oughta know the area 'round the No. 5 Reactor, right!
So let's hear YOUR explanation!
I'll help, too.
@#$%! I don't know even why you came!
Oh, BARRET! Are you mad because I'm not paying enough attention to you?
@#$%!!
CLOUD, come over here! Let's look at the Railway Map Monitor.
Hmm, it looks like you've seen this already…
It's all right. Come a little closer.
That's odd. The ID Check Point was supposed to be further down.
Type A Security Alert!!
Unidentified passengers confirmed…
A search of all cars will be conducted!
Repeat!!
Type A Security Alert!!
Unidentified passengers confirmed…
A search of all cars will be conducted!
What's happening?
What's goin' on?!
Jessie
We're in trouble.
I'll explain later. Hurry! Get to the next car!
@#$%! Someone blew it…
Let's go! Keep it up!
C'mon!! Hurry your slow ass up! That's it, huh?
Oh well…
We're gonna jump outta here!! Follow me!!
We got a lot of battles ahead of us. This's going to be tough.
Hmmm? You're the only ones that'll talk to me or come to my house.
I'm impressed.
Hm? You'd talk to me even now?
I'm really impressed. Here's a little something as a reward.
Received "Phoenix Down"!
If I die in the gutter, use that to revive me, okay?
Shinra Manager
Waaaaah!!
Don't…don't worry about me. (oh man, oh man, oh man…!! I'm gonna brag to everyone at work about this…)

Jessie
Just run!

Damn!! I guess there's no other way…
We gonna kick some ass!
What!? That's it!?

Jessie
Not yet. They're starting another check. If we're caught, we're done for!
But, don't worry. If we move up the train, car by car, we should get past it!
Damn, man!! Explain it right!
Jessie
You want an explanation? OK!! Let me.
Jessie
This train's security system is the old Shinra A system.
Once it identifies an illegal ID, the system automatically locks down each car.
It'll stay locked until it gets to the station, where Shinra guards will be waiting.
Jessie
But it's an old system, we can get past it.
If we move from car to car to the front, we should be able to go on as planned.
Jessie
The second detection scan should be coming up pretty soon. Let's go to the next car!
Jessie
Oh no!
Jessie
I'm so sorry.
It's my fault that we didn't clear the ID scan.
I modified the ID card for CLOUD and that's what made the sensors go off.
I did my best, but it just didn't work.
Jessie
I'll make a better one next time.
I'll head back to the hideout first and work on research and development.
…Oh, man…
The hell!? So this is as far as we go?
We were almost there.
We're gonna jump off here!! Follow me!!

OK, then. That's that.
Any idea what happened?
All I know is, when I woke up, the 3 of us were butt-naked!
But I guess you couldn't relate…
That scary broad made me take the bomb.
Of course I couldn't very well refuse her!

Because…
Hey you two! There ain't no time for that!
Yeah!! I've made up my mind!
Watch closely. I'm gonna jump!!
You don't care if I go first?
A leader always stays till the end.
Don't worry 'bout me, just go!
Yo! Don't go gettin' your spikey-ass hurt!
It's only the beginnin' of the mission!
Wedge
Guess who? It's me, Wedge!
Looks like things were a success.
Wedge
I look just like my little brother in these clothes…
I wonder how everyone is now?
Jessie
It's me, Jessie. How do I look, CLOUD?
Do I look good in a Shinra uniform?
Yeah…
Not now
…You look great, just like a man.
Just concentrate on our plan.
Jessie
Yay!! I'm so happy …I think?
Jessie
You're right, sorry.

A terrorist attack!
AVALANCHE is attacking!
Intruders!
More security's coming. It's dangerous to stay here.
Run
Stay here
That's one damn tiny hole. You tellin' me to squeeze into that to get under the Plate? No way!
Yo, CLOUD, what're we gonna do?
Look inside
Go down
Don't go
Don't be wastin' time. Never know when the Shinra'll find us.
CLOUD, you jus' gotta go.
Go down
Don't go
But, damn man, that thing gives me the chills.
Whaddya mean we're not goin' in? There ain't no other way of gettin' to the Sector 5 reactor 'cept through here.
…Doesn't seem to be anything that'll get us stuck in this duct.
After coming this far, only an amateur'd get caught by a security sensor.
Yeah. If we go down this duct, we won't be able to come back.
Good, so far everything's going as planned.
That was close. I thought we were gonna get caught…
Oh man…… We were forced to get this far out.
Don't let your guard down till we get to the Sector 5 reactor.
They probably don't know we sneaked in yet. We'll be at the reactor in no time.
We can't just go back now. We've gotta go on.
Biggs, Wedge and Jessie got everything ready for us. So MOVE it.
Biggs, Wedge, and Jessie did good. Now, it's our turn!
Jessie
I'm sorry.
Wedge
CLOUD, this way. The reactor's up this ladder.
Biggs
We're gonna pull out now. We'll meet up at the hideout.
CLOUD, we're countin' on you to blow the reactor!
Jessie
Next time, I'll give you something better.
I'll be back at the hideout in my research room workin' on it.
Jessie
The ID scan problem on the train was all my fault.
Jessie
I modified your ID card… And that's what did it…
Jessie
I did my best… But I failed.
The reactor's just down this tunnel!
Papa…
Sephiroth!?
Did Sephiroth do this to you?
Sephiroth…SOLDIER… Mako Reactors…Shinra…
I hate them all!
Damn man, get a hold of yourself!
You all right?
…TIFA.
Mmm?
No…forget… Come on, let's hurry!
I know. You're my chaperone, right?
Damn straight.
TIFA's old friend… That ain't good enough.
Let's hurry, CLOUD.
Alright, let's go.
Blin66_1-5, BLIN67_all, BLIN68_all, pillar_1-3, smkin_1
[Blin66_1 is missing, so I’ve had to piece this together as best I could]
Jessie said we all have to push the button at once.
No good. Let's try it again.
No.5 Reactor
This way!
Shinra soldiers!?
No.5 Reactor
$#%&! What the hell's goin' on?
…A trap…
Pres…President Shinra?
Why is the President here?
President Shinra
Hmm… So you all must be… What was it?
AVALANCHE! And don't ya forget it! So you're President Shinra, huh?
Long time no see, sir.
President Shinra
…Long time no see? Oh…you.
You're the one who quit SOLDIER and joined AVALANCHE. I knew you'd been exposed to Mako, from the look in your eyes…
Tell me, traitor… what was your name?
CLOUD.
President Shinra
Forgive me for asking, but I can't be expected to remember everyone's name.
Unless you become another Sephiroth.
President Shinra
Aah, Sephiroth… He was brilliant. Perhaps too brilliant.
Sephiroth?
Don't give a damn 'bout none of that! This place's goin' up with a big BANG soon! Serves y'all right!
President Shinra
And such a waste of good fireworks, just to get rid of vermin like you…
VERMIN!? That's all you can say? VERMIN!?
Shinra're the VERMIN for killing the Planet! Guess that'd make you King VERMIN! So shu'up jackass!
President Shinra
…You are beginning to bore me.
I'm a very busy man, so if you'll excuse me… I have a dinner I must attend.
Dinner!? Don't gimme that! I ain't even started wit' you yet!
President Shinra
But, I've made arrangements for a playmate for you all.
What's that noise?!
The hell is that!?
President Shinra
Now then, if you'll excuse me.
Wait, President!
President Shinra
Meet 'Airbuster', a techno-soldier. Our Weapon Development Department created him.
I'm sure the data he'll extract from your dead bodies will be of great use to us in future experiments.
Help, CLOUD!
THIS is from SOLDIER?
Yo, CLOUD! We've gotta do somethin' 'bout him!
No way! It's just a machine.
I don't care what it is!! I'm gonna bust him up!
It's gonna blow! Let's go, TIFA!
BARRET! Can't you do something?
Not a damn thing.
CLOUD! Please don't die! You can't die! There's still so much I want to tell you!
I know, TIFA…
Hey, you gonna be alright?
(Be strong)
(I don't know if I can hold on)
…
You worry about yourselves! I'm all right, but take care of TIFA!
…Alright. Sorry 'bout all this.
Stop talkin' like this is the end!
OK, hold on!
Don't go cryin' like a woman. There ain't nothin' I can do for ya. Ya gotta do it on your own.
BARRET…
&#%^! Can't hold on much longer. BARRET, hurry!
…Techno-soldier?
…You all right?
…Can you hear me?
…Yeah…
Back then… I only got scraped knees…
…What do you mean by 'back then'?
What about now?
Can you get up?
…What do you mean by 'back then'?”
…What about now?
…Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself now.
…I'll try.
…How about that?
Take it slow now. Little by little……
…I know.
Hey…who are you?
Oh! It moved!
Whew… What relief.
Hello, hello?
Hello, hello!
You okay?
You just fell from above. You really gave me a scare.
This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.
…I came crashing down?
The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky.
Flower bed…is this yours?
Sorry about that.
That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place.
They say grass and flowers won't grow in Midgar.
But for some reason, they have no trouble blooming here.
I love it here.
So, we meet again.
Don't you remember me?
Yeah, I remember…
Never saw you before
Yeah, I remember…
You were selling flowers
You're the slum drunk
Oh! I'm so happy!
Excuse me, but you're really rude!
…I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.
Thanks for buying my flowers.
You didn't buy any flowers from me though.
But I forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.
I don't remember a thing.
Well, that's okay.
Say, do you have any Materia?
Yes, some.
Nowadays you can find Materia anywhere.
But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.
…good for nothing? You just don't know how to use it.
No, I do… it just doesn't do anything.
I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's.
Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?
After all, here we are meeting again.
I don't mind
Got nothing to talk about
Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll just be a minute.
…Oh, I see.
Ahhh. I wonder whose fault that is. It's not easy to grow them, you know. Poor flowers.
Just a little longer.
Oh!
Now that you mention it…
We don't know each other's names, do we?
My name is…
I'm AERIS‚the flower girl. Nice to meet you.
I'm AERIS, the flower girl. Nice to meet you.
The name's CLOUD.
Me? I do a little bit of everything.
Oh…a jack of all trades.
Yeah, I do whatever's needed.
What's so funny? What are you laughing at?
Sorry, I just…
Huh?
CLOUD! Don't let it get to you!
Sorry, bad timing on my part.
Say, CLOUD. Have you ever been a bodyguard?
What's that?
You CAN do anything, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Then, get me out of here. Take me home.
OK… but it'll cost you.
OK then, let's see…
How about if I go out with you once?
Don't mind me.
I'll give you a little more time.
I don't know who you are, but…
You don't know me…
…I know you.
Oh yeah…I know you.
That uniform…
…Hey sis, this one's a little weird.
Shut up! Shinra spy!
Reno! Want him taken out?
Reno
I haven't decided yet.
CLOUD, don't! Stop!
Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!
CLOUD! Over here!
The exit is back there.
Reno
Did you see that guy's eyes?
Reno
They were…Mako eyes.
Reno
Hmm. All right, c'mon, get to work.
Reno
They were…Mako eyes.
Reno
Yeah, all right. C'mon, get to work.
Reno
Oh!
Reno
And don't step on the flowers…
You just stepped on them yourself!
They're ruined!
You're gonna catch holy hell!
Inside the Church
Church Roof
Here's a barrel.
If I can just push it over…
Here's a barrel.
If I can just push it over…
Push the barrel?
Yes
No
Reno
There they are, over there!
CLOUD…that one!
I know. Looks like they aren't going to let us go.
What should we do?
Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left.
AERIS! This way!
All right. I'll hold them off.
Right. Make sure they don't get through!
Reno
The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! > Attack!
Reno
Think we killed 'em? They never should've fought us!
Eaygh!!
AERIS!
CLOUD, help!
AERIS!
Hold on a minute!
Fight 'em!
RUN!
A, all right.
Guuagh!
Urkkk!
Nwahh!
Thanks, CLOUD.
Oh, CLOUD what are you doing!?
The Ancient! We got her!
Whew, that surprised me.
AERIS, this way.
CLOUD, hurry.
Damn!
What's that?
We'll get out through the hole in the roof.
Jump off that beam, and we should be able to make it through to the roof.
Church
Ha, ha… They're looking for me again.
You mean it's not the first time they've been after you?
…no.
They're the Turks.
Hmm…
The Turks are a Shinra organization. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER.
This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.
They're also involved in a lot of other dirty stuff on the side.
Spying, murder…you know.
They look like it.
But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?
No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER!
Maybe you do. You want to join?
I don't know… But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!
Then, let's go!
Sector 5 Slum
…
Wait… Wait, I said!
Puff… …wheeze…
Slow…down… Don't leave me…
Funny…
I thought you were cut out to be in SOLDIER.
Oh! You're terrible!
Hey…CLOUD. Were you…ever in SOLDIER?
…I used to be. How did you guess?
…Your eyes. They have a strange glow…
That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako… A mark of SOLDIER.
But, how did you know about that?
…Oh, nothing.
Nothing?
Right, nothing!
Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!

Whew! Finally made it off! Now what?
My house is over here. Hurry before they come.
The Sector 5 and Sector 6 slums are right ahead…
Do you know what kind of place they are? Tell me about sector 5 Tell me about sector 6
Yeah, I know
Sector 5 slum… It's not a big town.
No thrills, no danger. But there are a few stores so if there's something you want, stop by.
Sector 6 slum…heh heh heh, A man's paradise. I've always wanted to go.
…But not for a nice girl like you… But there may be something else good for you. Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, but it's a little dangerous over there, you know.
That's all I got to say. If you want to know more, you'll have to go there yourself. But you can't just waltz over there anytime you feel like it.
Hmm… Then, I'll do as I please.
HEY! Looks like they were in Sector 6. Have fun?
That reminds me, you don't hear much about Corneo lately. Wonder what happened to him?
I saw her! I really did!
This woman just disappeared! Right there around the old church.
I waited around a long time, but she never came out again!
I tell you, it's one of them …haunted churches! Ohhh…shiver…shake…
Then with a big rumble, the sector 7 plate came crashing down on the slum.
Oh man, if something like that ever fell on us…ohhh…shiver…
A really weird guy lives inside of some Huge Materia! And then there were 9 little devils! Ohh…shiver…shake…
Huh? Oh, uh, no, I uh… really didn't see it myself…I uh, well, it was more like a, whaddya call…rumor I heard.
All right. It was a lie. I just made it up because nothing's been happening around here lately.

This guy are sick.
He passed out nearby and someone must have helped him here.
That guy in the pipe's a weird one. No matter what you ask him, he only answers 'uuh' or 'aahh'.
Earthen Pipe
ooh…aaah…ughhhh…
This is the one… won't you help him?
Listen, I'm no doctor.
No, I guess not…
Hey…that man has a tattoo. I think it's the number 2.
Received "Elixir"!
Even with all that commotion, you went on like nothing happened. You must've really been through the mill to get like that.
I don't know, they might even be better off this way.
Even though they know the planet is on its last legs, there's nothing they can do about it.
I wish I could close myself off like that.
These folks went wobbling off somewhere…
They said something about the Reunion starting'… sounded almost like a chant. Wonder what the heck that meant.
…sniff…sniff…
First there was a rumbling… …then cracking… and then ker-blaMM!!…
…I was so scared…sniff…
Outta the way! Move! You want something? Move into the store!
You finally think you're making a living in the pits of Midgar, and then a big piece of scrap like that falls down here…what's next?
Yeah, that's right! But even so, where could we move to now?
You ever hear of Wall Market?
Yeah
Nope
It's a market in the slums of Sector 6. They've got everything you could ever want there.
Oh yeah? Then maybe I should have you pick something up for me next time you're there…
What's going on with the world? When it's all said and done, we're all gonna wind up dead.
You've been talking like that for sometime now.
What am I doing? I'm walking around looking at the ground.
You find a lot of things people dropped when you look down. You never find them when you're looking up. Right?
Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.
I'm not going to look up or down! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead.
Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.
Item Store
Hmmm,… …hmph…we only trade items for gil here.
Hmmm,… …hmph…we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.
Materia store
I don't care if it's scrap metal or Materia. We can get anything here in the slums.
Got a lot of good Materia here. Why don't you look it over?
You could live several lives in a place like this, and it still wouldn't be enough!
Well, how about some Materia? I gotta make some money and get out of here!
And I just got together enough money to get out of this place…
Now it doesn't matter where I go!
Hey!
Hey, didn't your mother ever teach you not to barge into houses and open up people's freezers?
Weapon Store
Taking care of yourself is the law of the slums. But to do that, first you need weapons, right?
You never know what's going to happen in this crazy world.
So you'd better have a weapon you can depend on! Am I right?
I don't know crap about crap! But I do know one thing. People are always gonna need a good strong weapon!
Huh? You want weapons? That's too damn bad…
I ain't got no weapons to sell ya! And the reason is…
…the weapon store's over that way.
…sure is loud outside. Wonder what's happening.
Toot toot! Next stop…Midgar Midgar.
Any passengers getting off at Midgar should please ring.
You know, Midgar's supposed to be sparkly 'n' springy 'n' sleeky.
Oh yeah. Someday, I'm goin' there.
Meteor's getting closer. You can hear it rumbling.
We don't do something about it and pretty soon it'll be…ker-blam!
House 1f.
Uh, test, test… This is a dummy message. A test. Is it coming through?
Hmph……! Everything President Shinra says is a lie.
But you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you call them.
You can bat it around all you like, but it all comes down to wanting to live like the people up there.
So who do I believe in? Myself! Me! I never lie to myself, that's for sure!
I believe only what I say. Because I never lie to myself.
And what's with the new president of Shinra, Inc.?
Hell, even the old president was better than him.
The hell's up with that!? I don't care if they're AVALANCHE or Avant-garde or whatever. Anyone who'd bring the plates down on us is nuts!!
SOLDIER? What about them!?
Damn! If they're really from SOLDIER, they should be doing something about all this!!
Me and my woman were going for a drive. Or at least we were supposed to until I had engine trouble and our plans fizzled.
Have you ever had that happen? I hate it when that happens!
A new standard in engines… the 'Shinra V-3000'. For the best drive of your car's life!
And now for the news.
A terrorist attack by the group called AVALANCHE has parts of Midgar temporarily out of power, but they will be restored momentarily.
Following President Shinra's address, Mayor Domino also spoke out today against AVALANCHE.
Now for the weather.
Tomorrow's weather will be overcast most of the day, with a slight chance of showers in parts of the city.
The cause of the accident is still unclear at this time, however, according to some sources it is believed to have something to do with the terrorist group, AVALANCHE.
Citizens, unite! Come to the light, Mako energy.
Power is Truth Shinra is the future. Real happiness can be found in obedience to the company!

I don't mind
No it's not!
Take good care of them.
That's too much to ask of kids.
Too much to ask?  What? I don't get it.
CLOUD, what are you saying!?
Will you take good care of my flowers, for me?
Yeah!
Sure!
They're purrty!
I'm gonna water them later…
Hey! Where's the flower lady?
church in the slums
I'm home, Mom.
Yeah.
This is CLOUD. My bodyguard.
Elmyra
Bodyguard? You were followed again!?
Elmyra
Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?
I'm all right. I had CLOUD with me.
Elmyra
Thank you, CLOUD.
So what are you going to do now?
…Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to TIFA's bar.
Is TIFA…a girl?
Yeah.
A girl…friend?
Girlfriend?
No way!
Yeah, that's right
Hee hee hee…
You don't have to get THAT upset…
Oh, how nice.
Well, that's…nice.
Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way.
You gotta be kidding. Why do you want to put yourself in danger again?
I'm used to it.
Used to it!?
Well, I don't know… getting help from a girl…
A girl!! What do you mean by that!?
You expect me to just sit by quietly after hearing you say something like that!?
Mom! I'm taking CLOUD to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.
Elmyra
But dear…I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind.
Elmyra
But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now.
Yeah, you're right, Mom.
Elmyra
AERIS, please go make the bed.
You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a little dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.
CLOUD…
Good night.
Oh, man…
CLOUD's House
…seem pretty tired…
…!?
I haven't slept in a bed like this …for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
Ever since then.
My, how you've grown.
I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.
…Not really.
…I'm worried about you.
There are a lot of temptations in the city…
I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down with a nice girlfriend.
…I'm all right.
You should have…
an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.
I think that would be best for you.
I'm not interested.
…I must've fallen asleep.
Sector 7's past Sector 6… I should be all right by myself…
CLOUD! I thought the Turks came back! Get some rest!
Can't get caught this time…
Elmyra
That glow in your eyes… you're from SOLDIER, right?
Yeah. Or, I used to be…
Elmyra
… I don't know how to say this, but…
could you please leave here tonight, without telling AERIS?
Elmyra
SOLDIER…the last thing AERIS needs is to get hurt again.
Through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. I should be able to do it alone…

Oh no! What ever will I do!?' …Isn't that what you want me to say?
Take her home.
Go on to Sector 7.
Isn't that a little out of the way?
Yeah, I guess so.
I could do that. But won't I be in your way?
What do you mean in the way?
Nothing!
Can we take a break?
I can't believe it's still here.

You know, in SOLDIER.
Oh, I was…
First Class.
Just the same as him.
The same as who?
My first boyfriend.
Were you…serious?
No. But I liked him for a while.
I probably knew him. What was his name?
It doesn't really matter.

This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find TIFA fast.
Please come in. There's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter now.
Please, stop by.
According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate.
So, build your strength by having a plate of our food.
It's a weird world we live in, so eat up and work hard.
I just can't make up my mind… Mmm.
Huh? About what?
Hmmm, don't make me say it… It's the shop down on the right.
Nope, I just can't make up my mind. Here, you take this. You won't be able to get in without it.

Hey boy! You sure got a good-lookin' heifer there!
Take her to the Don's place, and you'll make a mint.
Hey! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job!
Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune!
I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.
We're not leavin' this city no matter what happens.
Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?
We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?
Hey, y'all. Please stay here!
Oh… what should I do? Should I just buy it?
That was scary…
Seems like everything has frills on it.
Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?
It came down from the sky.
But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some, too.
I wish I could live with a real cat.
It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.
What? Are you ladies going to eat, too?
Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over.
I don't know what's gonna happen next. But first, you gotta fill your stomach.
What's wrong, AERIS?
What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but…
…Oh, yeah.
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. CLOUD.

All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?
All this belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps picking things up and saving them here.
Oh, you mean the owner who has a tank in his shop.
But any way you look at it, it's just trash…
Is this pile of trash getting bigger?
Yes, I think so.
A lot of things came falling down when the Sector 7 pillar fell.
Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff when it came falling down.
Oh is that why? He seems pretty suspicious these days.
Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?
Oh, you know! I wonder what he's doing?
Yeah! It gives me the chills.

Hey, you're pretty fast. TIFA's our newest girl.
But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.
Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.
Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride.
Hmm…Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.
Mmm! Please, please!

Looks like I need to go inside to complete my disguise.
See ya!
Uh, sir!! It's almost closing time…
So, please remember any personal belongings.
Uuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of cute girls…
It just seems natural to get cautious…
I bought some pretty flowers from AERIS.
500 gil, a little expensive. Well, at least I got her name.
AERIS… Thanks for the flower and 1 gil.
I'll treasure this! I'm going to dry it and keep it for good luck.
I asked AERIS for a date…
And she said not even if I paid her 1,000,000 gil. Her flowers cost 300 gil, too… She's a good business woman.
They bought lots of flowers from me.
It's closing time. …yawn…I'm so sleepy…
Sir, is everything all right? Look, AERIS looks so lonely.
Uurrgh! So, this is it for today, huh?
Ummm, young girls…soft skin. Ummm, OK, I'm refreshed now!
Mmmm? Pretty hard. You work out?
That's funny. A hard, spiky hairstyle! Looks kinda familiar…
Hey!! It's you!!
Sorry, but I already heard about you. In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things.
We only let cultured customers in! Got it? Then you'd better leave!
Heee… The Shinra have occupied this shop!
This shop is now under Shinra rule.
Corneo Hall
Hey, you got a cute one with you!
This is Don Corneo's mansion. He's a big shot here in Wall Market.
Listen, the Don doesn't like men. So get the hell outta here.
This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in Wall Market.
Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again…
Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.
I'll tell TIFA about you.
No!! You can't!!
Why?
Do you know what kind of …place this is?
Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion.
But, I just can't let you go in alone…Oh, man…
First…we need to find out if TIFA's alright…
What's so funny, AERIS?
CLOUD, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.
WHAT!?
Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
AERIS! I can't…
You ARE worried about TIFA, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!
A friend, huh? Sounds pretty good to me.
The Don will be happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can even…heh heh.
Bar
HEY…someone's IN here… Don't look!
Got any medicine on you? I'm too hyper…and…ugh.
What…urk…
Give her medicine
Don't give her it
Huh? You'll really give me some? Thanks.
Phew, I feel better now. This is for your kindness.
What is this? Oh well.
It didn't do a thing, but thanks anyways. Here, this is for your kindness.
Wasn't there a Pharmacy here?

Whoops!
Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter.
Man, times are bad.
Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?
I own the Clothes Shop… but I ain't your father.
I didn't say that…
Make me some clothes.
I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.
CLOUD, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to him.
Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.
You know, Mister.
He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl.
So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him…
What!? A tough lookin' guy like that?
So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?
…might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.
Then you'll do it for us?
Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?
Something…
That feels clean
That feels soft
hm, hm, hm, and?
And something…
shiny
that shimmers
Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste as him. I'll go talk to him.
Hey, hold on. Wait till I get an image in my head. Gulp…ummm, that's good.
…And then?
Hmm, hmmm, oh really?
Scary, isn't it? You just never know when the plate might come crashing down.
Yeah. I'd like to climb up to the plate if I could.

Sorry about that. Just forget it.
Really! I really appreciate it.
I'm sorry, but young lady… Would you turn the other way, for a second?
Why?
…AERIS.
Gosh!
I'm sorry, lady.
Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the Inn?
I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't ask a girl to go get it.
What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, I got in a fight with the guy at the Inn and can't go there anymore. Come on, so how 'bout it?
…
I'll go
Not interested
Finished?
Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done.
I got it.
Oh, really!! Hey!
Geez.
And, what was it?

A Stamina Drink Set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more business than him, his head'll spin.

You're gonna sell me something you just found?

I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe.
Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.
These days, you've got to have strength. Come on, you should work out.
All right…1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm.
I'm doing my best, bro'!

Are you the one who wants to be cute?
Cute?

And about the wig…
Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya.

Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can beat Big Bro!!
That's right!
So, you've got to compete with us!
You're right. Let's do squats.
All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!
Are you…
THE beautiful Bro?
What? You didn't know? Always running around here sayin' Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that…
Never mind that, come over here.
No, I'll explain the rules.
From the ready position, push [SWITCH] to squat, push [CANCEL] to get up, and push [OK] to go back to the ready position.
So it's [SWITCH], [CANCEL], [OK] in that order.
Got it?
Don't have it
Got it
Then I'll explain it again.
Whoever has the most squats after 30 seconds gets the wig.
I'm not going to lose.
Big Bro's wig is MINE!!
Just be quiet…
It's not fair for you to start right away, So, you want some practice?
A little
Don't need to practice
Then, start practicing!
You had  squats.
Now let's begin the real thing. Start!
He had  squats and you had  squats.
Sorry You lose.

What's the problem?
Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses.
And, where is your father?
He's probably plastered at the bar.
So… You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?
Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.
!
You'd help me bring him back?
Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?
Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore…

…'like you'? AERIS, what did you tell him?
Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!
Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.
Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?
Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, so the dress is on the house.
Walk more nicely like…this, Miss CLOUD.
…What do you mean 'nicely'?
Oh you're so cute, Miss CLOUD.
Looks like everything went well. He's been making the dress ever since he came back.
So? Were you able to get the wig?
Looks like you got it. So try it on for size.
Welcome. Please take your time.
Don't push! Hooligan!
You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it.
So, how was it? Were you able to see him?

Don't worry about it. It's a high class neighborhood, in the Big City.
You keep complainin' and we'll get in trouble.
Hey Grandma. What's the name of the company our son works for?
Oh, Grandpa. Did you forget again?

It's Shinra, you know, Shinra, Inc.? It's the biggest company in the city.
If it's the biggest company, it must be something.
Yeah. It IS really something.

Nice to meet you. I'm AERIS.
CLOUD's told me a lot about you.
…And you are?
Hey you're the one with CLOUD in the park…
Right, with CLOUD.
Oh…
Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
What do you mean, Don't worry'…about what?
No, don't misunderstand.
CLOUD and I grew up together. Nothing more.
Poor CLOUD, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.
Right, CLOUD?
CLOUD?
????
CLOUD!?
Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?
Never mind, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?
Slow down, let me answer.
I'm dressed like this because there was no other way to get in here.
I'm all right. AERIS helped me out.
Oh, AERIS did…
TIFA, explain what you're doing in a place like this?
Yeah, um…
Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
Please, go on with your private conversation.
…I'm glad you're OK.
Thanks. What happened?
When we got back from the Sector 5 reactor, we saw a weird man.
BARRET caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
That's when the Don's name popped up.
Right, Don Corneo.
BARRET told me to leave the lech alone…
But something's been bothering me.
I see. So you wanted the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
Well, I made it here, but now I'm stuck.
Corneo is looking for a bride.
Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then… …well…
Anyway, I have to be the …girl for tonight.
Sorry, but I overheard…
If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
I guess so, but…
We have two here, right?
No, AERIS! I can't involve you.
Oh? So it's all right for TIFA to be in danger?
No, I don't want TIFA in…
Is it all right?
I grew up in the slums… I'm used to danger.
Do you trust me?
Yes. Thanks, Ms. AERIS.
Call me AERIS.
He---y!!
It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!
I told you not to wander around… I tell ya, women nowadays…
Hurry up, will ya!
I guess I don't need to ask but, the other girl is…
me…right?
You're right, you didn't need…
…to ask.
They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
Ha ha. You know, you don't look bad, if ya don't look closely.
I wonder what BARRET would say if he could see you?
Embarrassed? Come on, speak up!
Hey, what's the secret?

Received "Phoenix Down"!
CLOUD!!
TIFA!!
You all right?
We've gotta help AERIS!!
Hey, don't you even care about how I am? ….nevermind, let's go!
Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!
No---!! Help!!
Kotch

Kotch

Kotch
C'mon…just once… I won't tell…I promise!
I just wanted to act like I got a a cute girl…
Just once!
AERIS!!
You all right?
We gotta help TIFA!
I told you. I'm used to danger.
To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding!
Ye…yes, you're right… …let's hurry!
Kotch
Ha ha ha… Wait, you…
Kotch
Hey! You're…not them… you're…
Corneo Hall,2f.
Don Corneo
Woo-hoo!
Come, come, don't be so shy…
Ye…yes…
But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first…
Don Corneo
Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by step. So come on!
No, that's not what I meant!
NO, STOP! Just, just wait a second!!
Don Corneo
Come! Come!
Aoooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes Papa!!
CLOUD!!
I know…
But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start…
Don Corneo
Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?
Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?
No…I wasn't asking about that…
Wait a minute! No, not yet!!
CLOUD!!
Don Corneo
…What the hell? Who's there?
I'm sorry, Don.
You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?
Don Corneo
What?
Shut up, we're asking the questions now…
What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell us…
…I'll chop it off.
Don Corneo
No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
So…talk.
Don Corneo
…I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.
By whom?
Don Corneo
No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!
Talk! If you don't tell us…
…I'll rip it off.
Don Corneo
Waaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!
Heidegger, the head of Peace Preservation!
The head of Peace Preservation!?
Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!
If you don't tell us…
…I'll smash it.
Don Corneo
…You're serious, aren't you… …ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy.
…I'm not fooling around here either, you know.
Don Corneo
Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.
Don Corneo
And they're really going to crush them…literally. By breaking the supports holding up the plate above them.
Break the supports!?
Don Corneo
You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING
and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums…
I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?
CLOUD, will you come with me to Sector 7?
Of course, TIFA.
Don Corneo
Just a second!
Shut up!
Don Corneo
No wait, it'll only take a second.
Why do you think scum like me babbled on about the truth?
Because I've given up on life
Because I'm sure I'll win
Because I'm clueless
Don Corneo
Buuzzzzz! Wrong!
Don Corneo
Woo-hoo!  Right!
Don Corneo
Close, but no cigar!
Don Corneo
Ahh, we're finally alone…
All right, pussycat… Come to daddy!!
Don Corneo
You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you.
Do you…like me, too?
Of course!
Umm…
Don Corneo
You sure do know how to make a guy feel good!
Then, wh…what do you want to DO?
Whatever YOU want, daddy
I don't care…
Don Corneo
Oh man!  I can't stand it! All right, then…
Give me a kiss!! A KISS!!
All right…
Nope, can't do that…
Don Corneo
Why? WHY? WHY?
Because…
Because I'm gonna need that mouth of yours to give me some information!!
Don Corneo
A man!? You tricked me!!
Somebody get in here NOW!!
Don Corneo
A man!? What's goin' on?
Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.
You're the ones from before! Wh…what the hell's going on?
Ju---st a minute!!
CLOUD…
Were you really…?
Information? What information?
Th…then why?
Don Corneo
You don't like me?
There…there isn't someone else, is there?
No, only you
Yes, his name's BARRET…
Don Corneo
No way!
Hmm? BARRET? That sounds familiar…
You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out about. You know, AVALANCHE…?
Don Corneo
Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7, in the slums.
Don Corneo
…and how do YOU know that!?
Don Corneo
Woo-hoo!
Don't be shy. We're all alone now…
Received "Hyper"!
Please, help me!
Help him
Leave him
Kotch
I…I was just following the Don's orders! Help me!
Kotch
Thanks!
You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying someone 'leaked information' and we're 'good for nothings'.
They took Don somewhere and that's it… I'm still here.
Kotch
Oops! They're here again… I'm outta here! SEE ya
Received "Ether"!
Turtle's Paradise No. 2 One thing even the Gold Saucer doesn't have is… A good place for drinks with a great atmosphere! Come on by and see us at "Turtle's Paradise"
President Shinra
How are the preparations going?
Heidegger
Gya, haa, haa!!  Smoothly, very smoothly! I assigned the Turks to this.
Reeve
President!! Are we really going to do this? Simply destroy a group with only a few members…
President Shinra
What's the problem, Reeve? You want out?
Reeve
…No.
But, as head of the Urban Development Department, I have been involved in the building and running of Midgar. That's why…
Heidegger
Reeve, flush your personal problems with the rest of your crap!
Reeve
The Mayor's against this anyway…
Heidegger
Mayor?
He just sits in this building all day feeding his face! You still call that a Mayor?
Heidegger
Now if you'll excuse me sir!
President Shinra
You're tired. Why don't you take a couple of days off and go somewhere.
President Shinra
We'll destroy Sector 7 and report that AVALANCHE did it. Then we'll send in the rescue operation, care of Shinra, Inc…. Heh, heh, heh…this is perfect.
Heidegger
Gya, haaa, haa!
Sewer
Man! This is terrible.
You alright?
Yeah.
Well, the worst is over…
Maybe not…
Let's try and jump down
Let's not…
It's too late… Marlene…BARRET …the people of the Slums.
Don't give up, never give up hope. It's not easy to destroy the pillar, right?
…Yeah…you're right! We still have time.
Train Graveyard
AERIS, I got you mixed up in this…
Don't tell me to go home.
If we can just get past the trains that are lit up, we should be able to get out of here.
[Save Point]
Received "Hi-Potion"!
Received "Ether"!
Received "Potion"!
Received "Echo Screen"!
We made it! The pillar's standing!
Wait! You hear something above us?
…gun fire?
BARRET?
I'm going up!
AERIS! You look after Wedge.
AERIS, do me a favor.
I have a bar called '7th Heaven' in this neighborhood.
There's a little girl named Marlene there.
Don't worry. I'll put her somewhere safe.
It's dangerous here! Everyone get away from the pillar, quickly!
Everyone get out of Sector 7!
Wedge!! You all right!?
Wedge
…CLOUD. You remembered…my name.
Wedge
BARRET's up top. …Help him…
Wedge
An' CLOUD… Sorry, I wasn't any help.
Wedge
CLOUD… It hurts…
CLOUD!! You've gotta go now, or BARRET's…
Hey now!! Oops!!
What on earth are you doing? Just butt out…geez!
Huh? You came to see it, too?
There was a bombing on top. If this pillar should come down, everyone in the slums is dust…
Well, there's no point in worryin' about that.
Hey!! Check it out! It's huge, ain't it?
Hey… This is a strange and wonderful place.
This is my place, but you can come here when you want. See ya, bro!
Ah…eh…uhm. Excuse me. You cannot pass without the proper clearance.
Did I do good this time?
You gotta be tougher!
But, uh, I…
W, wow! You're great!!
Damn right!! Don't waste time talkin's what I always say!
What the hell do you want? You know who I am?
You can't pass. I got the miserable job of keepin' scum like you from trying to sneak in here.
If you understand, then scram!
Listen… My partner's pretty mean, I wouldn't get him mad, if I were you.
You know, I got some tickets to 'Loveless', do you want to go?
What're you, retarded? Midgar's under martial law now!
Sir, are you really concerned for me?
Hell no!! But in case you forgot, we're in the middle of a slum. They could be anywhere around, so stay on your guard.
Right. You mean the AVALANCHE?
Don't you worry. SOLDIER has been added to the police force.
Boy, it's been a while since SOLDIER's been mobilized, hasn't it?
I ever tell you that I flunked the SOLDIER entrance exam?
Damn right!! blahblahblah…
Hey shut up for a minute and let me get back to work!
…sigh.
What are you more scared of AVALANCHE or me?
Oh, you, of course.
HALT!! No one is allowed to pass!!
[Save Point]
Don't worry. You let me handle this.
Uh oh… There goes the pillar.
I'm scared, but it's for your own good.
If things get too hairy, we'll escape. It's not something you'll see happen too often.
Uhh…Help! My strange and wonderful little place.
L, look… This is my job, so I have to be here until the absolute last minute.
Umm… I just LOVE men with a sense of duty. Let me stay here with you.
B, but… What happens if AVALANCHE shows up?
Umm…you're shaking. You're so gentle…I think I'm in love.
Doh! And this was supposed to be my last job! Do something!!
I never thought this would ever happen to me! Great… I'm quitting tomorrow!
Jessie
…CLOUD… I'm glad……I could talk with you…one last time.
Don't say 'last'……
Is that so…
Jessie
That's…all right…
Because…of our actions…many……people died…… this probably……is our punishment…
…Is…that so……?
Ha……cool……as usual… ex-…SOLDIER. …always…I liked that…in you…
Biggs
CLOUD… so you don't care…what happens… to the…Planet?
Nope, not interested
You're wounded……
Hmph…you haven't changed. Oh, forget it.
Thanks, CLOUD. …don't worry 'bout me…… BARRET's…fighting up there. Go help him…
TIFA! CLOUD! You came!
Be careful! They're attacking from the helicopter.
Better equip ourselves before they attack in full force!

Reno
You're too late. Once I push this button…
Reno
That's all, folks! Mission accomplished.
DAMN! It's a time bomb!
We have to disarm it! CLOUD! BARRET! Please!
Reno
I can't have you do that. No one get in the way of Reno and the Turks…
CLOUD! I don't know how to stop this. Try it!
…It's not a normal time bomb.
Tseng
That's right. You'll have a hard time disarming that one.
It'll blow the second some stupid jerk touches it.
Please, stop it!
Tseng
Ha ha ha……
Only a Shinra Executive can set up or disarm the Emergency Plate Release System.
Shut yer hole!
Tseng
I wouldn't try that…… You just might make me injure our special guest.
Tseng
Oh, you know each other?
Tseng
How nice you could see each other one last time. You should thank me.
What are you gonna do with AERIS!?
Tseng
I haven't decided.
Our orders were to find and catch the last remaining Ancient.
Tseng
It's taken us a long time, but now I can finally report this to the President.
TIFA, don't worry! She's all right!
Hurry and get out!
Tseng
Ha, ha, ha… Well, it should be starting right about now. Think you can escape in time?
We're not going to make it!
Yo, we can use this wire to get out!
Jus' hang on to me!
Once that Plate starts coming down it'll be too late. We gotta hurry!
Marlene! MARLENE!!
MAR---LE---NE!!
Biggs!
Wedge!!
Jessie!!
Goddamn it!!!
Dammit!
DAMMIT ALL!!!!
What the hell's it all for!?
ARGGHHHH!!!
Hey, BARRET!
BARRET!
Hey!
BARRET, stop… Please stop, BARRET.
URGHHHH!!!
God damn…
Marlene…
… BARRET?
Marlene is… I think Marlene is safe.
…huh?
Right before they took AERIS, she said, 'Don't worry, she's all right.' She was probably talking about Marlene.
Rrr, really!?
But…
Biggs… Wedge… Jessie…
All three of them were in the pillar.
Think I don't know that?
But…we, all of us fought together.
I don't wanna think of them as dead!
…And the other people in Sector 7.
This is all screwed up!
They destroyed an entire village just to get to us! They killed so many people…
…Are you saying it's our fault? Because AVALANCHE was here? Innocent people lost their lives because of us?
No, TIFA! That ain't it! Hell no!!
It ain't us! It's the damn Shinra! It's never been nobody but the Shinra!
They're evil and destroyin' our planet just to…
build their power and line their own damn pockets with gold!
Our fight ain't never gonna be over until we get rid of them!!
…I don't know.
What don't you know!? You don't believe me?
It's not that. I'm not sure about…me. My feelings.
An' what about you?
…
Yo!
Where's he think he's goin'?
Oh! AERIS!
Oh yeah, that girl. What's up with her?
…I don't really know… but she's the one I left Marlene with.
Damn! Marlene!!
AERIS said that Marlene was safe.
TIFA. There ain't no turnin' back now.
Sector 6 park
You may not take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "Sense" Materia!
CLOUD!
Take me to Marlene!
You're going to help AERIS?
Yeah… But before that, there's something I want to know.
What's that?
…It's about the Ancients.
Now listen good! The Ancients are the rightful rulers of this Planet!
"Sephiroth…?"
Are you all right?
Pull it together, man!
Sector 6
In my veins courses the blood of the Ancients. I am one of the rightful heirs to this planet!
Elmyra
CLOUD…wasn't it?
Elmyra
Well now, make yourselves at home.
Elmyra
It's about AERIS, isn't it?
…Sorry. The Shinra have her.
Elmyra
I know. They took her from here.
They were here?
Elmyra
That's what AERIS wanted…
Why is Shinra after AERIS?
Elmyra
AERIS is an Ancient. The sole survivor.
What did you say? But, aren't you her mother?
Elmyra
Not her real mother. …it must have been 15 years ago…
Elmyra
…during the war. My husband was sent to the front. Some far away place called Wutai.
One day, I went to the station because I got a letter saying he was coming home on leave.
You used to see this sort of thing a lot during the war.
Her last words were, Please take AERIS somewhere safe.
My husband never came back. I had no child. I was lonely. So I decided to take her home with me.
AERIS and I became close very quickly. That child loved to talk. She used to talk to me about everything.
She told me how she escaped from some kind of research laboratory, and that her mother had already returned to the Planet, so she wasn't lonely…many other things.
Returned to the Planet?
Elmyra
I didn't know what she meant. I asked if she meant a star in the sky,
but she said it was this Planet… She was a mysterious child in many ways.
Mom.
Please don't cry.
Elmyra
AERIS just blurted that out all of a sudden. When I asked her if something happened…
Someone dear to you has just died.
His spirit was coming to see you, but he's already returned to the Planet.
Elmyra
At that time I didn't believe her.
Elmyra
But…
Elmyra
Several days later… we received a notice saying my husband died…
Elmyra
…and that was it.
A lot had happened, but we were happy. Until one day…
Tseng
We want you to return AERIS to us. We've been searching for her for a long time.
No! Never!
Tseng
AERIS, you're a very special child. You are of special blood.
Your real mother was an 'Ancient'.
Elmyra
At that moment, I found out she was an 'Ancient'.
Tseng
The Ancients will lead us to a land of supreme happiness.
AERIS will be able to bring happiness to all those in the slums.
That is why Shinra would like AERIS's cooperation.
He's wrong! I'm not an Ancient! I'm not!
Tseng
But AERIS, surely you hear voices sometimes when you're all alone?
No, I don't!
Elmyra
But I knew. I knew about her mysterious powers.
She tried so hard to hide it, so I acted as though I never noticed.
It's amazing how she's avoided the Shinra for all these years…
Elmyra
The Shinra need her, so I guess they wouldn't harm her.
But why now?
Elmyra
She brought a little girl here with her.
Tseng found them on their way here. She probably wasn't fast enough to get away.
She decided to go to the Shinra in exchange for the little girl's safety.
…Marlene.
Marlene!! AERIS was caught because of Marlene!?
I'm sorry. Marlene's my daughter. I'm really sorry…
Elmyra
You're her father!? How in the world could you ever leave a child alone like that!?
…Please don't start with that. I'm always thinkin' about what might happen to Marlene, if I…
But you gotta understand somethin'… …I don't got any answers. I wanna be with Marlene… But I gotta fight.
'Cause if I don't…the Planet's gonna die.
So I'm gonna keep fightin'!
But inside I'm always thinkin' of her. I just wanna be with her…always.
See? I'm goin' in circles, now.
Elmyra
…I think I know what you mean. She's upstairs asleep, Why don't you go and see her?
It's my fault… I was the one who got AERIS involved in this.
Elmyra
Don't say that. AERIS doesn't think so.
I feel so depressed.
Elmyra
…sigh…
CLOUD!
I'm so glad… I'm so glad you're all right…
Marlene
Daddy, don't cry. Your whiskers hurt!
You gonna go help AERIS, right? She's done so much for me…
If the Shinra're involved, I ain't stayin' here! I'm comin', too!
Marlene
Guess what? Guess what? AERIS asked me lots of questions.
Like what kind of person CLOUD is. I bet she likes you, CLOUD!
I don't know
Let's hope so
Marlene
Dummy!
Marlene
I won't tell TIFA.
Looks like I can rest here.

Marlene
Daddy, TIFA, CLOUD! Please bring AERIS back!
You're going after AERIS, right?
I'm coming with you.
We're going right into Shinra Headquarters. …You gotta be prepared for the worst.
I know.
Right now, I feel I have to push myself to the limit.
If I stayed here…I'd go crazy.
Sorry, but can you take care of Marlene a bit longer?
Elmyra
Yes, I don't mind.
This place is dangerous now. You better go somewhere else.
Elmyra
…You're right. But promise me that you'll come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
Elmyra
I mean it, come back to her. Don't get yourself killed.
Received "Ether"!
Received "Cover" Materia!
How do we get to the Shinra Building?
There ain't no train that goes up there anymore…
…
Well, let's go to Wall Market. We might be able to find something there.
Wall Market
Everyone climbed up this wire. Looks scary…Brrr.
Oh man! This is horrible…
Hey, scary, huh? Dad told me that it's the Shinra's doing.
Can we climb it?
Yeah. It leads to the upper world.
Alright! We'll climb the wire!
There's no way we can do this. You know how far it goes up?
There IS a way! Look! What's that look like?
Just a normal wire.
Oh yeah? Well to me it looks like a golden shiny wire of hope.
You're right. This is the only way to save AERIS…
OK, that was a bad analogy, but, BARRET, I understand how you feel.
Let's go!
Plate Section
…Maybe if I put a battery in…
The propeller might work.
It might work if I put a battery in it.
I guess I'll just have to believe the shopkeeper.
Looks like the only way is to jump onto that bar.
Should make it if I jump before it comes too close. (use [OK] to jump)
Jumped too soon…
Jumped too late…
Need a battery here, too.
Damn, out of batteries…
Shinra Bldg.
Shinra Bldg. Stairs
Yo… You really gonna take these stairs all the way up?
Well we've got to get to AERIS to help her somehow.
Of all the out of the way…
I don't have time to argue with you! I'm going!
Y, yo TIFA! Don't go alone!
Wait a minute, CLOUD!
Shinra Bldg. Stairs
Don't know… why…the hell… we gotta…climb…
…because we don't want to start a commotion until we've saved AERIS.
If that's possible…
…heh heh heh.
Knock it off. You're giving me the creeps.
So even you will fight for someone else. Guess I figured you wrong.
Who cares what you figured!
I'm just sayin' mebbe I was wrong…
heh heh heh……
What's that supposed to mean, TIFA?
…how much farther do these stairs go on?
Why don't you ask them?
It's not one of them endless stairways or somethin', is it?
Of course not!!
Right…couldn't be that…
Are we there yet?
Not yet.
…there yet?
I said not yet!
Yo…
Look, don't even ask! We're way way way way far away from being there, OK!?
Yo… What floor is this?
…I stopped counting.
Why they gotta build these buildings so damn tall?
That Shinra… They're just no damn good.
…
…huff… Man, I'm beat…
Marlene, daddy wanted to see your face one more time…
Would you stop acting like a retard and climb!?
It's just a bit more!
…maybe.
Damn, man! I've had it! I'm going back!
It'll take just as long to go down as it did to come up.
…
C'mon, BARRET. Pull it together!
Yeah well, all I know is I'm only flesh 'n' blood… cept for this arm of mine.
Don't treat me like I'm some ex-SOLDIER or somethin'…
What about me!? I'm human too! Oh, do what you want, I'm going on!
…?
Yaah! BARRET! You go first!
What're ya ignorant?  …I didn't mean that
All right, all right!
CLOUD, you go on ahead too!!

Shinra Bldg.
Hey, you oughta know this building well.
What's wrong?
…Not really, now that I think about it, this's the first time I've ever been to the Headquarters.
I heard about this place before.
Every floor above the 60th is special and not easy to get to even for employees.
Must be where they took AERIS.
The security's pretty light now. Alright, let's go!!
Wait a second! You're not thinking of just going right through the main entrance, are you?
Well what else does it look like!? I'm gonna kick some Shinra butt and…
That's not going to work! We've got to find another way…
Ain't gonna be no other way! If we keep wastin' time like this, AERIS'll…
I know that! But if we get caught here…
Hey, CLOUD. …What should we do?
Let's bust on in!
Let's sneak in quietly
That's more like it! C'mon, let's go!!
See? Let's be careful and find a different route!
No, no! The Sister Ray's not this way!

Honey…would you buy me that car!
But baby, it's way too expensive.

…
Hh, hey!
Ww, wait for meeeeeee!
Please take all purchases to the register

Eagghhh!!

I don't want your money. AVALANCHE ain't no packa criminals.
We jus' want back what your boss stole from us.
I mean, "who" he stole from us.
A, AVALANCHE?
We ain't gonna hurt you. We might even pay ya, if ya help us.
Ok…ok…well…
What is it?
Thank you and come again… Forget I said that.
Welcome… to the fully automated store. Place your order…now.
Received "Pile Bunker"!
Received "Master Fist"!
You opened up all those things without asking and, hey wait!
This is the real thing. Don't let your guard down.
…I don't know. Now that you mention it, this's my first time at headquarters. What about you?
…I been here before. Back when I still had both my hands.
I hope AERIS is all right.
AERIS… She's been through a lot, huh.
Yeah
You too, TIFA
…What's wrong?
I didn't want to start a ruckus till we saved AERIS.
I should have known that was impossible though…
Heh, heh, heh.
What is it? You're givin' me the willies.
So there are times when even you fight for other people. I am impressed.
Who cares if you're impressed?
Y'know, I ain't so good at sayin' this but… Sorry…for…lots of things.
Wh, what the!?
Look!
DA-MN!
Just stop it, CLOUD! I don't care where!
What's going on!?
Oh man!!
No, uh, that's all right. My mistake. I'm, uh, not getting on.
Oh man!!
You…again?  Uh, I'll pass.
Elevator
Shinra Bldg. 59f.
Hey CLOUD!
We come this far, and you're thinkin' of goin' back down to the 1st floor?
Yeah
No…
No time for that now! Stop messin' around, boy!
Yeah, that's right! Let's go on!
Destroy the intruders!
What's this?
Received Key Item "Keycard 60"!
Shinra Bldg. 60f.
What're you doing here? Unauthorized personnel aren't allowed here!!
Your kind don't belong here! Go on, get out!
Hey there! What do you think you're doing there?
Look at all them guards runnin' around.
CLOUD, you go on ahead and signal us when it's safe to move.
Stay in the shadows!
When those guards turn around, MOVE!
What the hell're ya doin'? Man, you gotta do it again!
OK! We gonna rock!
Remember, we're here to save AERIS.
Hell, I know that!
I shoulda known it'd turn out like this…
If I knew it'd be like this in the first place…
Shhh! Now let's move on.
Wait for the soldiers to turn, then push [OK] to signal the others!
The hell are you? What're you doin' around here?
Where's AERIS?
…
AERIS? How did you know that name? You must be…
AERIS, you mean that kid. The receptionist? I was startin' to worry about her, too.
And so another rival appears on the scene, eh?
You mean, she's not? It's someone else?
Oh, I see. So you must be that whatcha call it…
Shinra, Inc. Repair Division!!
You know, this building looks like it's starting to fall apart.
This door was just pushed open. You ought to fix this right away.
Oh yeah, and take a look on the other floors, too. Here, take this.
Received Key Item "Keycard 62"!
This door is stuck wide open. Better fix this right away.
This is the lounge floor. Above us are the special floors for the company big wigs.
It's tough working under someone. It wears you out.
I thought I heard a ruckus downstairs a minute ago. Do you know what that was all about?
No idea. But no need to worry because everything above the 60th floor is safe.
What's keeping her? Did she forget her keycard?
Even employees can't access floors above the 60th without a keycard.
I don't remember seeing your face before… You new here?
Say, you're cute. Let me teach you some…things.
Things?
Um, I'm kinda in a hurry…
Oh? That's too bad…
Wipe that stupid look off your face. I was only going to teach you how to get to the next floor.
The higher ups in the company use the floors above the 60th floor. But you can't get there without a keycard.
Get a keycard and you can use the elevators freely.
…voila! Hear that sound and the door will open.
Just remember there are different types of cards. One keycard alone won't let you go everywhere.
For example,
'Keycard 60' only takes you to the 60th floor. Keycard 65' only takes you to the 65th floor.
It's a security system worthy of Shinra. After all, they control everything in Midgar and in the world for that matter.
Oh, I have to go. Gotta get back to work!

How do you do?
This is the Midgar Mayor's Office. Mayor Domino is in his office.
I am the Deputy Mayor. If you should have any questions feel free to ask me…
Domino
Hmm? Oh, and who might you be?
You all must be those…ahem… Me? I'm Domino, the Mayor of Midgar.
Actually, I'm Mayor in name only. The city and everything in it is really run by Shinra, Inc.
My only real job is watching over Shinra's documents…
Me! The Mayor! A librarian! Ohh…
You want to get upstairs? I tell you what, if you can guess the password, I'll give you my keycard.
Yes, that's it. Guess the password and I'll give you my keycard!
Get it on the first try and I'll even throw in a special item!
Domino
Got it? Then tell me.
So, what's the password?
BEST
KING
ORBS
BOMB
MAKO
HOJO
Wait a second
Domino
Nope! You're ALL wrong! It's a much better word than that! Try again!
Domino
BEST!!
God, I love the sound of that! BEST!! I AM the best…ME!! No matter what anyone else says, you'd better believe it.
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Domino
KING!!
God, I love the sound of that! KING!! President Shinra sucks! I should be King of Midgar!
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Domino
BOMB!!
God, I love the sound of that! BOMB!! I'm so angry, I'm like a walking time bomb waiting to explode!
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Domino
MAKO!!
God, I love the sound of that! MAKO! If I had a lot more of it, I would be a real Mayor!
…hmm. Well, OK. Here, take it.
Received "Keycard 65"!
Domino
Why would I do something like this, you ask?
Revenge, of course!
Shinra's been torturing me forever.
That's why I was a little rough on you all just now. Now go up there and really make them suffer.
This ought to teach them! Heh heh heh…
Domino
But my card will only get you to the 65th floor.
Can you believe how they treat me? …ME! Like some common employee…
Hart
Did you speak with the Mayor?
What? A password? Oh, I get it…
He's got way too much time on his hands. But you can't really blame him, Everything in Midgar is controlled by President Shinra.
Maybe I can help you.
What do you want to know?
The password…duh!
How about a hint?
Get out of my face
Hart
…I see. Then, I guess that's that.
Good luck finding it on your own.
If you decide you want help. I'll just be right over here. Ready to tell you anytime…
What can I do for you?
Give me the hint again
Give me the next hint
Uh, nothing
Hart
Sure, sure. All right.
As a public servant, it's my job to serve the needs of the people.
So here's a hint…
…for 500 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 1000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 2000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 5000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
…for 15000 gil.
Give him the money
Forget it!
Hart
What do you want to know?
HELP
Forget it
Hart
Hey now! You're a bit short.
No one works on credit nowadays… not even stores in the slums.
Hart
I can't believe it! I gave you all these hints, and you STILL don't get it?
You guys are amazing! Really, amazing…
Well, seeing as things have come to this, I might as well just tell you.
Hart
Oh, my…well, Thank you very much.
Now listen. On this floor are four research libraries for four different sections of Shinra, Inc….
Parts of the password are hidden in each of the libraries.
Pay careful attention to the files in each room.
The name of each library is written on the plaque outside the door.
Now, in each library will be one file mixed in from another library.
Look carefully at the numbers on each file.
There is a number at the beginning of each file name.
Look at the number on the files that don't belong in that library. Match the number with the letters in the title of the file.
If the file starts with a 4, then check the fourth letter and… well, you get the idea.
Hart
What do you mean the next hint? I've practically told you, didn't I?
…all right. Since this seems like a special case, I'll give you MY key card!
Hart
If you run into President Shinra, please don't tell him about this.
I can't be a partner to anymore trouble for Shinra.
Domino
I never thought you'd get it on the first try…
Just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Oh well, a promise is a promise. Take this, too.
Received "Elemental" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Domino
What…full already? Come back again when it's empty.
Received "Elixir"!
Received "Ether"!
Received "Potion"!
Domino
Hmm. It appears you're not completely stupid.
Fine then, take this.
Domino
I see… For you…this might be best.
Then, this is for all of you.
Domino
Hoo boy! You finally got it?
You all really don't use your heads much, do you?
……What the hey. Here, just take it anyway.
This is the Scientific Research Library.

When construction of Sector 6 finishes, Shinra's plan will be complete.
That must be why he took
Is it just me or does the Conference Room smell? There's some sort of stench coming from somewhere…
It gives me the feeling that I AM alive. The feeling of moving this world, just with my hands.
Whew, I'm so sick of carrying all these files…
But I get to meet lots of guys. I guess that's the benefit of being a secretary!
Come on, we're building the future of Mako!
…………………… Phew!
Geez--! That's a lotta suits!
We have the damage estimates for Sector 7.
Considering those factories we already set up and all the investments, the damage is estimated at approximately 10 Billion gil…
Reeve
The estimated cost to rebuild Sector 7 is…
President Shinra
We're not rebuilding.
Reeve
What?
President Shinra
We're leaving Sector 7 as it is.
And restarting the Neo-Midgar plan.
Reeve
…then the Ancients?
President Shinra
The Promised Land will soon be ours.
President Shinra
I want you to raise the Mako rates 15% in every area.
Palmer
Rate hike! Rate hike! Tra, la, la! And please include our Space Program in the budget!
President Shinra
Reeve and Scarlet will divide the extra income from the rate increase.
Palmer
Oh man!
Reeve
Sir. If you raise the rates, the people will lose confidence…
President Shinra
It'll be all right.
The ignorant citizens won't lose confidence, they'll trust Shinra, Inc. even more.
Heidegger
Ha ha ha!
After all, we're the ones who saved Sector 7 from AVALANCHE!
That dirty #$*$^
President Shinra
Hojo. How's the girl?
Hojo
As a specimen, she is inferior to her mother. I'm still in the process of comparing her to her mother, Ifalna, but for now the difference is 18 %.
President Shinra
How long will the research take?
Hojo
Probably 120 years. It's probably impossible to finish in our lifetime. Or in the lifetime of the specimen too, for that matter.
Hojo
That's why we're thinking of breeding her. Then we could create one that could withstand our research for a long time.
President Shinra
What about the Promised Land? Won't it hinder our plans?
That's what I need to plan. The mother is strong… and yet has her weaknesses.
They were talking about AERIS…right?
I dunno.
Probably.
Let's follow 'em.
Scarlet
Something stinks…
President Shinra
That concludes our meeting.
Flush?
Climb up?
Get out of here
Hojo…huh…?
I remember him.
That Hojo guy. He's in charge of the Shinra's Science Department. CLOUD, don't you know him?
This is the first time I've actually ever seen him. So…that's what he looks like…
Is this today's specimen?
Hojo
Yes. We're starting right away. Raise it to the upper level.
Hojo
My precious specimen…
Precious specimen…?
Is it going to be used for a biological experiment?
Jenova…
Jenova… Sephiroth's… So…they've brought it here.
CLOUD, be strong!
Did you see it?
See what?
It's moving……still alive?
Where's its $#&*&@ head? This whole thing's stupid. Let's keep goin'.
Let's see… The specimen Hojo asked me for is…
That elevator back there is only to transport Specimens. You can't use it. It would be a lot easier if it led to the 68 Floor Research Lab.
Hojo
AERIS? Oh, is that her name? What do you want?
We're taking AERIS back.
Hojo
Outsiders……
Shoulda noticed it earlier, you…
Hojo
There's so many frivolous things in this world.
Hojo
Are you going to kill me? I don't think you should.
The equipment here is extremely delicate. Without me, who could operate it? Hmm?
Ugh.
Hojo
That's right. I recommend you think things out logically before you make any rash moves.
Hojo
Now, bring in the Specimen!
What do you think you're doin'?
Hojo
Lending a helping hand to an endangered species… Both of them are on the brink of extinction…
Hojo
If I don't help, all these animals will disappear.
…animal? That's terrible! AERIS is a human being!
You're gonna pay!
CLOUD, help!
BARRET! Can't you do anything?
Awright!! Step back!
Hojo
Stop!!
Hojo
Wh…what are you do-- Oh! My precious specimens…
Hojo
This is no ordinary specimen. This is a very ferocious specimen!
Now's our chance to get AERIS!
Thanks, CLOUD.
CLOUD…what's wrong?
…The elevator is moving.
Oh shit… We're surrounded.
He's rather strong. I'll help you all out.
It talked!?
I'll talk as much as you want later, Miss.
We'll take care of that monster.
Somebody take AERIS somewhere safe…
What's your name?
Hojo has named me, Red XIII. A name with no meaning whatsoever to me. Call me whatever you wish.
Come on!
AERIS, you all right?
She seems all right, …in many ways.
I have a right to choose, too. I don't like two-legged things.
What are you?
An informed question. But difficult to answer. I am what you see.
…You must have many questions, but first, let's get out of here. I'll lead the way.
CLOUD… so you did come for me.
I apologize for what happened back there. I was merely acting to throw Hojo off guard……
Now we've saved AERIS, ain't no need to be in this buildin'! So let's get the hell outta here!
If all five of us go together, we'll be noticed. Let's break up in two groups.
I'll see you later!! We'll be waiting at the 66th Floor Elevator.
We'll be going first! Meet at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Later! Meet up at the 66th Floor Elevator!
Don't be late. Do you know where the Elevator is? The 66th Floor!
No! Please don't kill me. I only did what Hojo told me to do.
To prove it to you…here, this is the key card to the 68th Floor. Would I be doing this if I was the enemy?
Where you goin'? Everyone's waitin' at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Where are you going? Everyone's waiting for us at the 66th Floor Elevator.
Not that way! Everyone's on the 66th Floor Elevator.
You don't have a Card Key
H, hey! What is it?
Rude
Would you press 'Up' please?
Turks! Must be a trap…
Tseng
This must've been a real thrill for you… Did you enjoy it?
Ggh…
They got you, too?
Where is AERIS!?
President Shinra
In a safe place.
President Shinra
She's the last surviving Ancient…
President Shinra
Don't you know? They called themselves the Cetra, and lived thousands of years ago. Now they are just a forgotten page in history.
Cetra…that girl is a survivor of the Cetra?
President Shinra
Cetra, or the Ancients, will show us the way to the 'Promised Land'. I'm expecting a lot out of her.
The Promised Land? Isn't that just a legend?
President Shinra
Even so, it's far too appealing not to pursue.
It's been said the Promised Land is very fertile.
…If the land is fertile…
then there's gotta be Mako!
President Shinra
Exactly. That is why our money making Mako Reactor is necessary.
The abundant Mako will flow out on its own.
President Shinra
That is where Neo-Midgar will be built. Shinra's new glory…
@$#*^%! Quit dreamin'!
President Shinra
Oh really, don't you know? These days all it takes for your dreams to come true is money and power.
President Shinra
Well, that is all for our meeting.
Hold it! I got a lot to say to you!
President Shinra
If there's anything else… talk to my secretary.
Rude
Come on! Outta his way!
I wonder how BARRET is doing
I wonder how RED XIII is doing
I wonder how AERIS is doing
I wonder how RED XIII is doing
I wonder how AERIS is doing
I wonder how BARRET is doing
I wonder how AERIS is doing
I wonder how AERIS is doing
I wonder how BARRET is doing
I wonder how RED XIII is doing
Let's just get some sleep
I wonder how RED XIII is doing

Let's just get some sleep
Let's just get some sleep
Psst (Can we get out?)
Psst (CLOUD, you're so brave!)
Psst (Don't give up!)
Hey!
AERIS is an Ancient and the real name of the Ancients is Cetra.
The Ancients know where the Promised Land is and the Shinra is searching for that Promised Land.
I only heard stories 'bout the Promised Land. I don't know if it really exists.
Is that right?
The Shinra believe that the Promised Land is full of Mako energy.
Which means, if the Shinra get there, they'll suck up all the Mako energy.
…and the land'll wither away. The Planet's gonna get weaker.
I can't just leave 'em be. I'm recruitin'new members!!
Me, TIFA, CLOUD… and AERIS too.
How 'bout you?
You're so damn boring.
…………Grandpa.
Grandpa!?  Ha, ha, ha…… Grandpa, hmm……ha, ha, ha……
What's so funny?
Nothin'……ha, ha
CLOUD, are you there?
AERIS!? You safe?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I knew that CLOUD would come for me.
Hey, I'm your bodyguard, right?
The deal was for one date, right?
…………oh, I get it.
…!? TIFA! TIFA, you're there too!
EXCUSE me.
You know, AERIS. I have a question.
What?
Does the Promised Land really exist?
…I don't know.
All I know is…
The Cetra were born from the Planet, speak with the Planet, and unlock the Planet.
And……then…
The Cetra will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises supreme happiness.
…What does that mean?
More than words……I don't know.
…Speak with the Planet?
Just what does the Planet say?
It's full of people and noisy. That's why I can't make out what they are saying.
You hear it now?
I, I only heard it at the Church in the Slums. Mother said that Midgar was no longer safe. That is…my real mother.
Someday I'll get out of Midgar… Speak with the Planet and find my Promised Land.
…That's what mom said.
I thought I would stop hearing her voice as I grew up, but…
What's happened?
The door's open… When did it open?
TIFA… Wake up!
What's wrong?
Something's wrong. Look outside.
This's kinda eerie…
I wonder what happened…
He should have the key on him…
Come on, TIFA, get AERIS. I'll go help BARRET and the others.
…What happened?
BARRET, RED XIII …come with me. Something's wrong.
How'd you get in? Why's the door open!?
The hell's goin' on!?
No human could've done this.
I'll go on ahead.
I'll clean up back here, so you guys go ahead. And don't get caught by Shinra!
Come on, let's follow RED XIII!
Jenova Specimen… Looks like it went to the upper floor using that elevator for the specimens.
It looks like it leads up…
He's dead… The head of Shinra is dead…
Then this sword must be…
Sephiroth's!!
…Sephiroth is alive?
…Looks like it. Only Sephiroth can use that sword.
Who cares who did it!? This is the end of the Shinra!
Uh!
Palmer
P, p, p, please, don't kill me!
What happened?
Palmer
Se…Sephiroth. Sephiroth came.
Did you see him? Did you see Sephiroth?
Palmer
Yeah, I saw him! With my own eyes!
You really saw him?
Palmer
Uh! Would I lie at a time like this!? I heard his voice, too!
Palmer
Um, he said something about not letting us have the Promised Land.
Then does that mean
the Promised Land really does exist and that Sephiroth's here to save it from Shinra?
So he's a good guy then?
Save the Promised Land? A good guy? No way!!
It's not that simple! I know him! Sephiroth's mission is different!
Rufus! &*%$! I forgot about him!
Who's that?
Vice President Rufus. The President's son.
I only know his name.
I heard that he'd been assigned somewhere else for a long time…
I wonder what sort of person he is?
I've heard that no one's ever seen him bleed or cry.
Rufus
So… So Sephiroth was actually here. …By the way,
Rufus
just who are you?
I'm CLOUD, ex-SOLDIER, First Class!
I'm from AVALANCHE!
Me too!
A flower girl from the slums.
A Research Specimen.
Rufus
What a crew.
Rufus
Well, I'm Rufus. The President of Shinra, Inc.
You're only President 'cause yer old man died!
Rufus
Correct. I'll let you hear my inauguration speech.
Rufus
…Father tried to control the world with money and that worked for him.
Rufus
The people believed that Shinra would protect them.
Rufus
Work at Shinra, get your pay. If terrorists attack, the Shinra army will help you.
It looked perfect on the outside.
Rufus
But, I do things differently.
I'll control the world with fear. It's too much to do it like my old man.
Rufus
A little fear will control the minds of the common people. There's no reason to waste good money on them.
He likes to make speeches just like his father.
Get AERIS outta the building!
What?
I'll explain later! BARRET! This is the real crisis for the Planet!
The hell's that supposed to mean?
I'll explain later! Just take my word for now! I'll go after I take care of him!
Alright, CLOUD!
Rufus
Why do you want to fight me?
You want the Promised Land and Sephiroth.
Rufus
That's right.
Rufus
Did you know that Sephiroth is an Ancient?
…Whatever, I can't let either you or Sephiroth have the Promised Land!
Rufus
I see. I guess we won't be allies.

You got caught up in this over Marlene. Now, it's my turn to help you!
OK, playtime's over jackasses…

Who you callin' Mr. BARRET? That don't sound right!
Well then…
If you are through talking, may I suggest that we think of a way to get out of here.
Huh? Oh, oh yeah… You're cold, man. Just like someone else 'round here I know.
Did you say something?
Notta thing. So what're we gonna do?
BARRET!!

Well, what do we do now?
Sephiroth is alive. …I have to settle the score.
Will that save the Planet?
…It seems so.
Then, I'm going!
I'll go, too. There are things I need to know.
About the Ancients?
…Many things.
I guess it's good bye, Midgar.
We told AERIS's mom to go somewhere safe, so Marlene should be safe, too.
Yeah, she should be
Hmm, I don't know
She said she didn't want to stay in Midgar anymore. …Maybe it's for the best.
Stop it, CLOUD! I'm worried, too.
You know what? This is the first time I've ever left Midgar…
Really? Are you worried?
It's dangerous. Are you sure you want to go?
A little…no, maybe a lot. But I have a bodyguard, right?
I thought you'd say that!
…I guess this is the start of our journey…
You hate traveling?
It's dangerous. You sure you want to go?
…I don't know. But, I don't have anywhere else to go. So I guess it doesn't really matter whether I like to travel or not.
…Hmm. But you know, it should be all right if you keep your promise.
I'm going back to my hometown. I'll go with you as far as that.
Then…
Let's stay here for a while
Let's go!
To the Northeast, there's a town called Kalm.
The food at the Inn's good. Why don't we head there first?
You're right. I've heard about that town before. CLOUD?
About Sephiroth, and about the crisis of the Planet…
You're right. We need to know where Sephiroth went.
We need a leader for our journey. Course that could only be me.
You think so?
I think it should be CLOUD.
^#$^%…alright. Go Northeast to a town called Kalm. If something happens, we'll meet up there.
'Sides, we can't have five people strolling around out there. It's too dangerous. Let's split into two parties…

Thanks to the Mako energy Shinra, Inc. develops for us, everything's more convenient now.
Maybe a little too convenient.
I hear that the natural resources near the reactors are being sucked dry.
We're better off with the Mako energy.
The famous floating city, Midgar… Just once I'd love to see it in person.
What does it do? It checks the pressure of the Mako energy sent from Midgar.
This is the Item Store.
This is the Weapons Store.
This is the Materia Store.
I heard terrorists bombed a Midgar reactor…
There have been a lot of dangerous accidents recently. I hate it, just hate it.
It seems there was this group called AVALANCHE runnin' around, but I guess SOLDIER finally wiped them out.
Shinra is trying to eliminate anyone, who stands up to them.
It don't matter if we like it or not. Shinra's taken over, and we gotta live with it!
Stay out of the kitchen.
I heard President Shinra was killed. And his son Rufus, the new president, was badly hurt.
Hey, I bet that's news to you?
You're pretty smart!
Don't care…
Heh, heh…Just between us… I heard it was them Ava-whaddya call-ums that got President Shinra and his son.
Don't care? If you're going to travel, you'd best keep an eye on what Shinra's doing.
When I grow up I'm gonna be in SOLDIER. That's why I'm training hard now!!
My older brother's so stupid. He's so embarrassing I could just puke!
Hyah, hayah, eagghh!
Hyah, hayah, eagghh!
Hyah, hayah, eagghh!
Thanks to Mako energy, life's pretty darn convenient. Thanks to Shinra.
Don't you think?
Yeah, maybe
You're full of it
See!? How would we get by without Mako energy?
Hmm. But I'd hate to think of what life'd be like without Mako energy.
Mako energy's made things a lot more convenient…
But a lot of plants and animals have been disappearing at a rapid pace.
I think the old life was better.
Don't you think so?
Yeah, maybe
No way
Yeah, sure I'm right! You think so, don't you?
That's just what my mom said.
Yeah, Mako energy's made life much easier. And it's all thanks to Shinra, Inc.
Things were better when you could play with animals…
Listen to me! Something really big's happening in Midgar.
They were just saying on TV it was Rufus' second strategy and…
That big cannon's pointed due north… Do you think the target is Sephiroth?
Everyone at Shinra's in an uproar because they heard Weapon's coming.
I heard a big hydroplane carrying secret weapons, was attacked by Weapon and was sunk at sea…
If something ever happened to President Rufus, That'd be the end of Shinra, Inc. and the rest of the world, too.
Did you say you came from Midgar?
I used to live there, too. But I heard they got lots of troubles lately.
Is it true that Shinra makes monsters?
It's true
Just a rumor
Yeah, well either way, as long as we use reactors, we can't stand up to Shinra.
There was a suspicious-looking man in a black cloak! He was carrying a mean-looking sword.
They say Midgar's in the middle of a war between the Shinra and some terrorists called AVALANCHE.
20 gil a night. What's it gonna be?
Stay?
Move on
Mr…CLOUD? Your party is waiting for you on the 2nd floor.
Shinra's leading the world around by the nose, and you guys are just gonna sit back and take it?
Me? I used to work in a mine down south called Mythril Mine
But, awhile back, monsters started appearing.
After that, business went to pot and now I spend the days here drinking.
Urrrp!…hic… I'm stinking drunk!!
Seems like you're a little short. Why don't you drop by again… when you have money.
Why doesn't anyone believe me? I'm so lonely…
Listen to me! Just now, some guy in a black cloak walked east towards that grassy field.
He's got this killer sword, and looks REAL scary…
Aw, c'mon! Listen to me! Got anything interesting to say?
Locked. Can't open it…
I gotta hurry up and get strong so I can crush Meteor to bits! But I gotta train real hard to do it.
Oh man, oh man!
Meteor's gonna fall on us, and now some huge monster like I've never seen is wandering around out there!
What's going to happen to all of us?
I want you to stop that talk about Meteor falling on us!
Listen, I work hard…and now you're tellin' me Meteor's gonna smash everything to bits?
Well, I ain't standin' around listenin' to fool talk like this. Makes a person lose the will to work, that's what it does!
What're ya, dense? Something like that'll never happen! It's ridiculous!
And all of Midgar's gonna be destroyed by a falling meteor? Oh, don't make me laugh!
There's been a number of scary incidents lately. I hate it. Just hate it!
I heard the remaining members of AVALANCHE smashed the Shinra troops at Midgar.
Lately, there's been a number of scary incidents. I hate it. Just hate it!
They say the remaining members of AVALANCHE broke Shinra's resistance and destroyed the Mako cannon at Midgar.
What's going to happen to the world?
I heard Shinra's taking it's biggest artillery from Junon and other facilities and gathering it in Midgar to fight Meteor and Weapon.
Even if Meteor falls, you ought to be safe as long as you're in Midgar.
They say it's a "Mako Metropolis" so it will survive.
Ah, youth… You really believe that big meteor filling up the sky is going to fall?
If that's the case then all we can do is put our hope in Shinra, Inc.
If Shinra, Inc. was our last hope, and they've been beaten by terrorists… Are we all going to die?
Meteor's going to fall, isn't it? Then we're all history unless Shinra does something about it!
Why're you checking the Mako energy pressure at a time like this? It's probably already too late.
You can't go into a tail spin at a time like this. You've got to keep living just like before. At least that's what I think…
They say Meteor's going to fall, but that's okay! I'm sure Shinra'll come through for us in the end!
Dear, can you believe it? They say that Shinra's gone under!!
This world is coming to an end all because some terrorists called AVALANCHE stuck their noses in the wrong place!
I can't believe Meteor's really falling this way… What's going to happen to us?
I can't believe Meteor's really falling this way… What's going to happen to us?
Meteor's coming, right? Where will I stash my money? Wait, maybe I'd better take it with me and get out of here!
One night, 300 gil. Wanna check in?
Yes
No
Tourists, huh? Here are a few things you should know that will come in handy when you travel around the world…
Want to hear what they are?
Tell me
I already know
Then let me explain how to use the world map.
Well then, what do you want to know?
Changing camera angles
Map indicators
Operating the buttons
Anything else you'd like to know?
Map indicators
Operating the buttons
Nope, I got it
Anything else you want to ask?
Changing camera angles
Operating the buttons
No, that's all
Anything else you want to ask?
Changing camera angles
Map indicators
No, that's all
First press [CAMERA] to change the camera angle.
There are 2 angles to choose from, select the one you like.
Then rotate the camera either way by pressing [PAGEUP] or [PAGEDOWN].
Try different angles until you find the one you like best. It makes the journey a lot more fun!
Press [START] once to view the World Map.
There is a large and small map. Learn when to use which and you won't get lost.
Push [START] twice to change the size of the map, and once more to turn it off.
Pretty easy, huh?
Ride things by pressing [ASSIST] and get off by pressing [CANCEL]. This isn't so hard, either!
Oh, right. You can't dash on the World Map, so make sure not to press [CANCEL] unless you want to get off.
Remember this because Chocobos will run away as soon as you get off them, so be careful.
Once on the World Map you can access the menu to save your game anywhere. It's a good idea to save frequently!
Well then, bon voyage!
Is that so? Well, that's that. Have a nice trip.
Damn!!
Oh! You!!
…don't mess with me!!
Huh? You're looking for your friend? You want to know where the Lifestream is?
Hmm, I can't help you find your friend, but I've heard about the Lifestream.
When I traveled to the Southern islands, a doctor was very kind to me. I seem to recall him telling me something about the Lifestream…
Hey, listen to me! The Shinra troops are on the move.
The TV news said Rufus came up with two plans. One, is to launch a rocket into space containing Huge Materia…
Is Huge Materia really that destructive?
Sephiroth put up a huge barrier around the North Crater.
Rufus wants to use a mammoth cannon to smash the barrier.
He plans to have Shinra troops rush in and attack Sephiroth after the barrier falls.
The North Crater barrier's been demolished?
So now's the time to defeat Sephiroth.
Hey, listen to me! I heard the barrier protecting Sephiroth is gone!
But with Rufus dead, the Shinra troops don't know what to do. Heidegger and Scarlet don't have what it takes to lead the troops.
I really thought something was finally going to happen, but everything's the same… Not a damn thing changes around here!
My old man was a miner, but he couldn't go to work after monsters started appearing in the Mythril Mines.
Now all he does is sit around getting drunk in the bar…
My dad still just sits at the bar drinking, even though he knows Meteor's coming!
It's sad. Even though he's an adult, he just doesn't want to see the world as it really is. I dunno what to do.
South of this town past the Mythril Mine and far to the west is a Shinra harbor called Junon.
They say there's a reactor and many tall buildings there. I hope to see it someday.
The world's at peace… all's well.
Tomorrow's another day… all's well.
I got my health, and enough to eat… all's well.
The world's changed a lot in the past few days…
That huge Meteor is covering up the sky and acting like it owned it.
A lot of my friends have died…
I'm goin' on a journey to pray for their souls.
A map that was sunk along with the ship. ..."Guidebook" A rose that blooms once every 1000 years in the desert. ..."Desert Rose" A harp that soothes those who hear it. ..."Earth Harp"
I wonder if there's anyone who'll bring it to me?
Now if I can just get the "Guidebook", I can start my journey…
Now if I can just get "Desert Rose", I can stary my journey…
Now if I can just get "Earth Harp", I can start my journey…
"Guidebook" and "Desert Rose"… Will you guys look for them for me?
"Guidebook" and "Earth Harp"… Will you guys look for them for me?
"Desert Rose" and "Earth Harp"… Will you guys look for them for me?
OH! It's "Guidebook"! Wanna trade it for this Underwater Materia?
How about it?
Trade
Don't trade
OH! It's "Desert Rose"! Wanna trade it for that Chocobo over there?
How about it?
Trade
Don't trade
OH! It's the Earth Harp! Wanna trade it for some Master Materia?
I'm not bein' stingy either! I'll give you all three of 'em!
How about it?
Trade
Don't trade
Ok then, it's a done deal!
I dunno…
it's Underwater Materia. Go on, it's yours!
It's a Chocobo. Take it, it's yours!
It's a 3-piece Master Materia set, …and it's all yours!
I guess it's time to go on a journey for the souls of my departed friends…
Looks like my Stable's full. I'll come back when I have room.
CLOUD, you're late!
Yo man, you're late!
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Guess everyone's here now.
So let's hear your story…
You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis of the Planet.
Let's hear it all.
…I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.
After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends.
You call that a friend?
Yeah, well…
He was older than me, and hardly ever talked about himself.
So I guess you'd call us war buddies… We trusted each other. Until one day…
…
…One day?
After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.
…that was five years ago.
I was 16…
It sure is raining hard.
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm all right.
I wouldn't know…
I've never had motion sickness.
Everything okay?
Sephiroth
Hey.
Sephiroth
Settle down.
They gave me some new Materia.
I can't wait to use it.
Sephiroth
…Just like a kid.
You going to brief us about this mission?
Sephiroth
This isn't a typical mission.
Good!
Sephiroth
Why do you say that?
I joined SOLDIER to be like you.
But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.
My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.
That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.
Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?
Sephiroth
…I thought you wanted a briefing?
Sephiroth
Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.
Sephiroth
There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.
First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.
Brutal creatures? Where?
Sephiroth
The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
Nibelheim…
That's where I'm from.
Sephiroth
Hmm…hometown…
Sir…s, something strange just crashed into the truck!
Sephiroth
That would be our Monster…
Sephiroth
Come on, let's go to work.
Sephiroth's strength is incredible. He is far stronger in reality than any stories you may have heard about him.
So… Where do you come in?
Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
…and then we reached Nibelheim.
Nibelheim
Sephiroth
How does it feel?
Sephiroth
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?
Sephiroth
So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown…
Ummm…how 'bout your parents?
Sephiroth
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father…
Sephiroth
What does it matter?
Sephiroth
All right, let's go.
Yo wait a minute!!
Isn't that, uh…?
The name of Sephiroth's mother…
I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.
That's right.
BARRET, would you please let us hear what CLOUD has to say? You can ask questions later.
TIFA, I was only…
Ok CLOUD, continue.
The childhood friends are reunited!
…I was really surprised with TIFA.
Sephiroth
The Mako smells pretty bad here.
Psst… (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
Being on watch is so boring.
You want to do what we always do?
Just sit tight, it's your job, right?
Shall we practice?
I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.
Practice? Oh, you mean practice my pose.
Do members of SOLDIER always have to worry about what others think?
How did it go?
…Was it like this?
Good job!
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
Nibelheim
…The town was quiet.
Everyone must be in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters.
No, maybe they're afraid of us…
Sephiroth
We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
Sephiroth
All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.
Sephiroth
Oh, and…
Sephiroth
You may visit your family and friends.
Man… I'm so nervous.
How come?
I'm excited.
Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?
…That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero…
Hey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation…
Hmm? You from Shinra?
That's right!
Who are you?
Geez… Big-headed young kid.
I'm the town's… …. …!?
Aren't you CLOUD?
Don't you know me?
You're TIFA's…
Right. I'm TIFA's father.
…Long time no see, sir.
TIFA's father
…Stay away from my daughter.
TIFA's father
We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!
TIFA's father
If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits…
TIFA's father
I hate myself for asking you this, but…
Don't take your eyes off of TIFA! Hurry up and go back to her side!
TIFA's father
Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.
I heard Sephiroth was coming so I brought my camera.
I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
Take my picture.
Get back in the house, it's dangerous.
I don't take pictures of nobodys.
All right… Fat-head…
Hey? This guy's a real…
You… Are you CLOUD?
Really? So that's how it is, huh?
Gosh, CLOUD, you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad.
Then take my picture
It's dangerous, go home
Let's do this, CLOUD. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth.
OK, OK… Fat-head… You're just his assistant.
Think they'd let me take a picture?
What's Sephiroth doing?
Sephiroth
Once the guide gets here, we're heading out.
TIFA's father
Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens…
Sephiroth
…Trust me.
I'll be all right, Dad!
I have two men from SOLDIER with me.
I'm TIFA. Nice to meet you!
TIFA! You're the guide?
That's right.
It so happens I'm the number one guide in this town.
It's too dangerous! I can't get you involved in this!
Sephiroth
There's no problem if you protect her.
Sephiroth
…Let's go.
Umm…
Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!
TIFA, can you ask him for me too?
Great, thank you!
I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!
Cheeeeese!
This Mansion…
…No, I'll come here later.
Sephiroth
Hey, stay over here!
Up ahead is…Mt. Nibel.
I'll tell you about the time I went into the mountains.
Sephiroth
Hey, calm down! Wait over here.
…Late again.
I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep…
Zangan
There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?
Why?
No way!
…Why do you ask?
It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.
Zangan
The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be embarrassing to the company.
You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.
Zangan
…Oh my. You sure do have faith.
Is that you, CLOUD?
…Yeah
…No
Mom?
Here, I've brought you something!
Don't tell anyone in town!
Received "Homemade Potion!”
Nibelheim Inn
The, uh… The whole inn's booked up by Shinra for the night.
…?
CLOUD?
Is it you, CLOUD?
It must've been two years.
Say, you've really moved up in the world, being under Sephiroth's command.
Wow…
This is really, somethin'.
You used to be such a scrawny kid, and now look at you!
So, what do you need, CLOUD?
Where's Sephiroth?
Give me a room
How is the town?
He's upstairs.
You STILL haven't found one yet?
It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?
Now about the town…
A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.
Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.
It was all right when they were building the reactor,
…while they were still building it.
But once it was completed, it's been bad.
Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.
I don't know if the reactor was good or bad…
I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But what can you do about it?
Anyhow, we've got to get rid of the monsters.
Then, we'll be able to relax a little bit.
I'll let you in on a secret…
The Shinra aren't really popular here.
You know what I mean, right?
You're from here, so you know.
It's the same story I always tell. You still want to hear it?
Yeah, tell me again
No, that's all right
Hey, you want to rest?
Yes, please
Forget it
It's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest.
Hmmmm
Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
And who are you?
I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.
Zangan
I have 128 students all over the world!
In this town, a girl named TIFA is my student.
Did you say TIFA?
Zangan
TIFA has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.
Zangan
I want to see some Shinra techniques.
And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.
Well, good luck.
Will we be able to use this place, too?”
Zangan
Oh? Did you come crying home?
I think you probably know better than I do, but…
Nibelheim Inn
Sephiroth
…
Sephiroth
…We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
It's still early.
Yeah, let's get some sleep.
Sephiroth
…I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.
What are you looking at?
Sephiroth
…This scenery… I feel like I know this place.
Sephiroth
I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.
I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her…
It was the morning after that, right TIFA?
Yes, right…
We're short one bed…
This is…my house. It has nothing to do with what happened five years ago.
Hey…
I can't…remember much else. There's…nothing more to talk about.
That's all right, CLOUD.
Yo wait, I wanna hear.
Me too! It's been a long time, right?
Tell us more!
You saw your family, right?
Don't want to talk about it
All right…
Well, I ain't gonna force ya…
I don't know if you'd call it a 'family'…
My father…died when I was still young.
That's why my mom…… lived alone in this house.
Yeah, I saw my mom.
My mom…she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all.
But a few days later, she died…
But when I saw her, she looked fine.
Uh?
Yes?
CLOUD!?
Welcome home, CLOUD!
Hi, Mom.
Come, come… Let me take a look at you!
Hmmm…
You look so handsome.
So is this a SOLDIER uniform?
…Mom, I…
Are you eating right?
I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
Is that so?
I know you can't cook…
I've been worried sick about you.
CLOUD?
You know, CLOUD…
…isn't that right, CLOUD?
I'll always be your mother…
…Let's stop this…
TIFA's House
CLOUD?
Did you go in my house?
Yeah…
No…
I thought you might be home.
I remember you weren't there.
TIFA's House
CLOUD?
Did you go into my room?
Yeah
No
Received "Orthopedic Underwear!"
CLOUD!!!
It's true
Just kidding. Don't get mad.
…CLOUD
We're talking about something really important here.
The letter…
Did you read it? My letter?
I'd never do that!
Yeah…
Of course!
You remember what it said?
I don't remember
I remember clearly
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
Dear TIFA…
(Remember)
(Stop)
I read it…
It was a letter addressed to TIFA from the son of the guy that runs the General Store…
TIFA, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.
Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was CLOUD.
But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.
Well, enough about him.
CLOUD… Do you remember all of it?
No, that's it
Yeah, I remember
Because there was some stuff about me…
Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything… so out of it.
Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.
Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money.
…But, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first.  That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.
I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.
I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.
I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.
Hey, TIFA… Is that stupid old water tower still working?
Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?
And most of all, how are you, TIFA? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.
We were all talking about you last night.
Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.
I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.
Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!
So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.
P.S.  Write me back, okay?
Nibelheim House
…Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.
Making the rounds?
Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, CLOUD! I didn't recognize you.
Shinra----?
Chinra---?
SOLDIER?
SALTZA?
Are you going to kill the monsters?
Are you going to…?
….
These kids are also Sephiroth fans…
He's soooo cool!!
Way cool!!
CLOUD, you've grown up to be a strong man.
Have a safe trip.
Do your best.
Do your best.
Nibelheim Item Store
Welcome.
Hey? Aren't you…?
…Have I been here before? …I don't remember.
Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!
Oh, oh, you're…
A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel.
The cold mountain air of Mt. Nibel
was the same…
It gets harder from here! Follow me!
I'm all right. You be careful too, Guide.
Let's hurry.
Uh…the bridge!!
Sephiroth
Everyone seems to be all right. Will we be able to get back?
These caves are intertwined, like an ant farm…
Oh, and Sephiroth… One person seems to be missing…
Sephiroth
It may sound cruel, but we've no time to search for him. We can't go back, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.
What's this?
A mysteriously colored cave…
Sephiroth
It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
…And what's this?
Sephiroth
A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
It's so beautiful…
If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too…
Sephiroth
Materia. When you condense Mako energy, Materia is produced.
It's very rare to see Materia in its natural state.
By the way… Why is it that when you use Materia you can also use magic, too?
Sephiroth
You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?
Sephiroth
…the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the Materia.
Sephiroth
Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the Planet calling up magic…or so they say.
Magic…a mysterious power…
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha !
Did I say somethin' funny?
Sephiroth
A man once told me never to use unscientific terms like 'mysterious power'! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'!
I still remember how angry he was.
Who was that?
Sephiroth
Hojo of Shinra, Inc…. An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist.
He was a walking mass of complexes.
A Mako fountain… So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
TIFA, you wait here.
I'm going inside, too! I wanna see!
Sephiroth
Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
But!
Sephiroth
Take care of the lady.
Mm, man!
Better take real good care of me, then!
Yeah, I remember.
Hmm…so it was you?
This is…Jenova, right? It won't open…
Sephiroth
This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken.
CLOUD, close the valve.
Sephiroth
Did you close the valve?
Sephiroth
Why did it break?
Sephiroth
…Now I see, Hojo.
But doing this will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast.
Sephiroth
This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy… that is, when it's working correctly.
Now…what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?
Uh, umm…Oh yeah!  It becomes a Materia.
Sephiroth
Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. …Take a look.
Sephiroth
Look through the window.
Wh…what is this!?
Sephiroth
Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako.
You're different from the others but still human.
But, what are they? They've been exposed to a far higher degree of Mako than you.
…Is this some kind of monster?
Sephiroth
Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters.
Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monsters really are.
Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
H…hey, Sephiroth!
Sephiroth
No…
Sephiroth
…Was I?
Sephiroth
…Was I created this way, too?
…Sephiroth.
Sephiroth
Am I the same as all these monsters?
Sephiroth
You saw it! All of them…were humans…
Human!? No way!
Sephiroth
…Ever since I was small I've felt…
…that I was different from the others. Special, in some way.
Sephiroth
But… not like this…
Am I…human?
I didn't really understand what Sephiroth meant then.
I was even more surprised that Shinra was producing monsters.
Yeah, maybe so. Wanna take a breather here?
Hmph! Pokin' his damn nose in where it don't belong. CLOUD! Why don't you finish that story?
(Phew……)
(Why you talkin' to me!?)
Save game and take a rest
Keep talking
…I get it.
That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.
I think we should listen carefully to CLOUD. Don't you think so BARRET?
Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
…Who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held such a secret.
TIFA… Were you waiting outside then?
…Yes.
We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself to the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
The villagers used to call it the Shinra mansion.
Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion…
There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room…
Sephiroth seems different.

Choco Bill
Thinking of crossing the marshes?
Yeah
Not interested
Choco Bill
Hmm, then it'll probably be safer for you to get a Chocobo.
Choco Bill
That way you can zip through the marshes with the Chocobo.
It's the only way to avoid being attacked by the Midgar Zolom.
Choco Bill
Midgar Zolom…?
Choco Bill
It's a serpent-like creature over 30 feet tall!!
Choco Bill
It detects the footsteps of anyone in the marshes.
Choco Bill
And then, BAM!! It attacks!!!
Choco Bill
To avoid that, buy a Chocobo at me and Choco Billy's Chocobo Farm.
To purchase a Chocobo, please talk to my grandson. He's in the Chocobo stables at the far right end of the farm.
Choco Bill
By the way, there was another person heading towards the Marshes.
Without a Chocobo, the Midgar Zolom probably got him. It was a man in a black cape.
Choco Bill
Welcome.
Choco Bill
How 'bout a Chocobo Lure Materia?
Each level it increases, makes it easier for you to find a Chocobo.
Choco Bill
Hmm, then, I guess that's that.
Choco Bill
Still want to cross the Marshes?
Yeah
No
Choco Bill
Looking for an Inn?
Yeah
Not interested
Choco Bill
Looking for an Inn?
Yup
Nope
Choco Bill
Looking for a place to stay?
Right
Nope
Choco Bill
How about 100 gil a night…?
All right
I'm in a hurry
Choco Bill
Thank you for your patronage.
Choco Bill
… Ummm, you don't have enough…
Please    for a second.
Chocobo farm
Choco Bill
Oh, what is that?
What has this world come to? Stars falling, what's next?
Choco Bill
With things the way they are now, how 'bout raising a Chocobo?
No, I'm not trying to persuade you for money. It's just because of the way things are in the world.
I thought that it would be a healthy thing for you to raise some Chocobos…
Choco Bill
Hmm…You just happen to be in luck!
It just so happens that we aren't taking care of any Chocobos for anyone else, so…
Choco Bill
I could take care of 6 Chocobos right now, for 10000 gil per Chocobo. How 'bout it?
Take care of my Chocobos
Tell me something else
How do you raise them?
Nothing
Could you take care of the Chocobos?
I'd like to hear about something else
Tell me how you raise them
That's all
Take care of my Chocobos
I wanna hear about something else
How do ya raise 'em?
That's enough
Choco Bill
To raise a Chocobo, you'll need a Chocobo Stable'.
And they rent for 10000 gil. Currently, I can rent out up to 6 Chocobo Stables'.
If you rent a 'Chocobo Stable', we will keep up to 4 of the Chocobos you catch in the fenced area outside.
At a later date, you can select the Chocobo that you would like to put in your Chocobo Stable'.
Choco Bill
'Chocobo Stables' cost 10000 gil…
Rent it
Don't need it
Choco Bill
We don't have enough room to rent out more than 6 here…
Choco Bill
Thank you.
My grandson takes care of the Chocobos. He's in the Chocobo Stable at the far right of the farm. Please tell him what you want.
Choco Bill
Someone once told me there is a Chocobo Sage'…somewhere.
He seems to know how to raise some great Chocobos.
If he really does exist, I'd like to meet him someday.
Choco Bill
Chocobos aren't hard to take care of.
The day-to-day care will all be done here.
But, please buy the food for the Chocobo, and feed them yourselves.
Chocobo's abilities will differ with what you feed it, so feel free to choose your own food.
Also, if you're able to find a male and a female Chocobo that like each other, they'll produce an egg. But only if you feed them a 'Nut'.
New Chocobos inherit the abilities of their parents.
I've heard that sometimes new breeds of Chocobo are born with special abilities. I've never actually seen it before, though.
Chole
Welcome.
Chole
Wasn't it really expensive?
Chole
But don't be mad at my brother or Grandpa.
Chole
Ever since Mom and Dad died, it's been like this…
Chole
Welcome! Here's some good advice.
The white Chocobo likes it when you scratch behind its ears.
But if you scratch it someplace that it doesn't like, it'll get mad, so be careful.
Choco Billy
Do you want a Chocobo?
Mmm…
Give me one
Nope
Choco Billy
You old folks are out of luck!
Old folks…?
Choco Billy
Oh, I'm so glad!
Choco Billy
We're all out of Chocobos. I'm taking care of the ones out there for someone else.
Choco Billy
You know, if you really want a Chocobo, you should go out and catch one.
Choco Billy
Want to know how to catch a Chocobo?
Where are they?
How do I catch one?
What else?
Not interested
Choco Billy
You see those claw prints out there? Wild Chocobo's will appear in those areas.
But, if you don't have 'Chocobo Lure' they won't come out. They're very cautious by nature.
Chocobo Lure?
Go on
Choco Billy
'Chocobo Lure' is a type of Materia which attracts Chocobos.
If you equip this, they'll come to you. But, without it, they won't appear.
Choco Billy
A wild Chocobo always appears with other monsters.
But, you won't be able to catch it because of the monsters.
That is why you must defeat the monsters first before you catch the Chocobo.
And then?
Is that all you can talk about?
Choco Billy
Wild Chocobos are really cautious. They'll run away from the smallest things.
But, if you use 'Greens' they'll focus on them and won't run away.
Choco Billy
Whatever you do, don't make Chocobos angry. They're usually calm, but if you get them angry, you'll get hurt.
Oh, and remember, once you get off a Chocobo, it'll escape.
Choco Billy
Well then, shall we get down to business?
Choco Billy
I'll sell you the 'Chocobo Lure' for 2000 gil, right now.
Choco Billy
You want it?
Buy it
Don't buy it
Choco Billy
Thanks!
Choco Billy
Hey, you don't have enough.
Choco Billy
Mmmm, if you don't have it, you'll never catch one.
Choco Billy
The 'Chocobo Lure' is 2000 gil. Buy it now?
Buy it
Don't buy it
Choco Billy
It wouldn't hurt to buy some 'Greens', either.
Oh, and how fast a Chocobo'll finish eating depends on what type of 'Greens' you feed them.

You must return the Chocobo that's out, if you want to take out a different one.
Choco Billy
Which one are you going to take?
Choco Billy
Ride this one?
Giddyap!
Whoa!
Choco Billy
You have all the 'Chocobo Stables' you can carry.
If you want to put a Chocobo in it, first, you must let it go and open a 'Chocobo Stable.'
Choco Billy
You don't even have any 'Chocobo Stables'
If you want to raise Chocobos, go talk to Grandpa.
Choco Billy
It looks like you haven't even caught one yet…
Choco Billy
Which one are you going to put in the 'Chocobo Stable'?
Use the Directional button left or right and [OK].
Choco Billy
This…is a wonderful Chocobo!
Choco Billy
This is a great Chocobo.
Choco Billy
Mmm, this seems like a good Chocobo.
Choco Billy
This Chocobo's so-so.
Choco Billy
This is a pretty average Chocobo.
Choco Billy
Mmm, this one's not bad.
Choco Billy
This one doesn't seem to be very good.
Choco Billy
I really can't recommend this one.
Choco Billy
Want to put this Chocobo in your stable?
Put it in
Let it go
Choose a different one
Choco Billy
Then, give Chocobo Ç#& a name.
Choco Billy
I'm really going to let him go.
Choco Billy
In order for the Chocobo to mate, you need a male and a female…
Choco Billy
In order for them to mate, you need 'Nuts' too.
Choco Billy
You don't have any 'Greens'… It just so happens I can sell you one…
Feed?
Mating?
Chocobo by the fence?
Ride it outside?
What are "Classes"?
Nothing
Choco Billy
Yeah, you can ride this one.
And even if you take it outside, this Chocobo won't run away when you get off of it.
If you want to return it to your 'Chocobo Stable', just ride it onto the farm.
Then, you'll be able to feed it again.
Choco Billy
What the Chocobo eats are 'Greens'. The most famous one is the 'Gizzard Greens'.
Chocobos will mature differently depending on which 'Greens' they eat. Certain 'Greens' will boost their stamina.
You'll have to figure out which kinds have what effects for yourselves.
Oh, and Chocobos are born with certain natural abilities. So, no matter how much they mature, they can't get more abilities than what they're born with.
If a Chocobo's abilities don't increase even when you feed it, that means it's reached its limit.
It's best to let those kinds of Chocobo go or mate them to get a new Chocobo.
Choco Billy
A male and a female Chocobo together can produce an egg.
Choco Billy
The Chocobo out there is part of the stock that you caught.
We can only keep 4 Chocobos here at once. If you get a fifth one, the first one will have to be let go.
If you don't want that to happen, come back and put it in your own stable.
Choco Billy
Chocobos' strengths are divided by 'Class'.
Choco Billy
Which Chocobo are you going to let go?
Choco Billy
There's still lots of room to grow.
Choco Billy
It might mature a bit more.
Choco Billy
Don't expect it to mature anymore.
Class
Choco Billy
Your 'Chocobo Stable' is empty.
Choco Billy
Is it all right to let this one go?
Go ahead
No, don't
Go ahead
No, don't
Choco Billy
Gizzard Greens =
Karaka Greens =
Tantal Greens =
Pasana Greens =
Kurie Greens =
Memit Greens =
Reagan Greens =
Sylkis Greens =
Don't feed it
Choco Billy
Looks like you don't have any 'Nuts'… To get them to produce an egg, you need a 'Nut'. Do you want to buy some?
Choco Billy
You better have a 'Chocobo Stable' prepared for the little ones, too.
Choco Billy
I can't give you anything I don't have.
Choco Billy
Which 'Nut' are you going to give 'em?
Choco Billy
Which Chocobo are you going to feed it to?
Choco Billy
Is this all right?
Yeah
No
Choose another one
Choco Billy
Is this one all right?
Yes
Give it a different Nut

Pipio Nut =
Ruchin Nut =
Saraha Nut =
Lasan Nut =
Param Nut =
Porofu Nut =

Don't give 'em anything
Choco Billy
They gotta be male and female.
Choco Billy
Which two Chocobos are you going to mate? Talk to the two you like and make your decision.
This one
Different one
This one
Different one
Never mind
Choco Billy
There's only one…
Choco Billy
So let's mate these two.
Go ahead
No, I changed my mind
Speed Plus!
Stamina Plus!
Intelligence Plus!
They're getting along better!
Their personalities improved!
No improvement…
Choco Billy
You got yourself a new Chocobo!
Looks like it's got good speed.
Looks like it's got good stamina.
Looks intelligent.
Too much energy?
Choco Billy
You shouldn't mate those that just mated or those that were just born.
Choco Billy
There doesn't seem to be any others you could mate it with.
Chole
Hey, do you know what a Chocobo Sage is?
Chole
What!? You've actually met him!?
Wow! What did he tell you?
Chole
Wow, that's amazing! …Let me take some notes.
Chole
Hey, did you ever see the Chocobo Sage again? What did he tell you?
Chole
What?
Let me jot this down
Chole's Chocobo inspection
Nothing
Chole
For telling me that story, I'll tell you about each Chocobo's abilities.
Chole
I think it's `$& .
Chole
That's `$& 
Chole
From what I see, the fastest sprinter is…
Chole
And, the fastest one is…
Chole
Also, from what I can tell, the one with the most stamina is…
Chole
Finally, the most intelligent one is…
Chole
There are no Chocobos.
Chole
Hey, there's only one Chocobo.
Chole's Memo #1
Other than regular Chocobo, there are Mountain Chocobo' and 'River-Chocobo'.
Chole's Memo #2
In order for the 'Mountain Chocobo' and River Chocobo' to be born, Feed the 'Carob Nut' to a 'Great Chocobo' or a 'Good Chocobo' and have it produce an egg. But we don't sell any Carob Nuts'.
Chole's Memo #3
A 'Great Chocobo' and a 'Good Chocobo' are found… on an island southeast of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling at Corel and in the area west of Corel. The 'Carob Nut' can be found south of the Chocobo Sage's dwelling. Monsters carry them. Let's see, is Bone Village just south of there?
Chole's Memo #4
One surprise: If you get the "Mountain Chocobo" and the "River Chocobo" to produce an egg, You'll get a Chocobo that can cross mountains and rivers. I bet that the right nut for that is the "Carob Nut."
Chole's Memo #5
Bigger surprise: There seems to be a Chocobo that can cross the ocean. If you could cross the ocean, mountains, and rivers, there'd be no place you couldn't go.
Chole's Memo #6
In order to get an Ocean Chocobo you need to get a Mountain-and-River Chocobo to mate with something else.
Chole's Memo #7
If you mate the Mountain-and-River Chocobo with a 'Wonderful Chocobo', you'll get an Ocean Chocobo.   But to do that you can't use an ordinary Nut.
Chole's Memo #8
The 'Nut' that produces Ocean Chocobos is the 'Zeio Nut'. This is the first I've ever heard of it. I wonder where you get them?
Chole's Memo #9
Zeio Nuts are found on a little island east of the Chocobo Sage. Goblins' have them. With this, you can produce an 'Ocean Chocobo'.
Chole's Memo #10
According to my research, Mountain, River, and Ocean Chocobos are hard to produce. But, if you take the right care of the Chocobo and increase their Class ranking by winning at the races, it'll increase your chances of getting one.

Well if you know, then this won't take long.

It's difficult to explain what the Turks do…
Kidnapping, right?
Rude
To put it negatively… you could say that.
Rude

Elena
It's all right, Rude! I know you don't like speeches, so don't force it!
Rude
Then explain, Elena.
Elena
I'm the newest member of the Turks, Elena. Thanks to what you did to Reno, we're short-handed.
Elena
…But, because of that, I got promoted to the Turks…
Elena
Anyhow, our job is to find out where Sephiroth is headed.
And to try and stop you every step of the way.
Elena
Wait a minute, it's the other way around… You're the ones that are getting in our way.
Tseng
…Elena. You talk too much.
Elena
Sorry…Tseng.
Tseng
I thought I gave your orders.
Now go. Don't forget to file your report.
Rude
…Reno said he wanted to see you after the injuries you gave him healed.
He wants to show his affection for you all… with a new weapon.
Tseng
Well, then…
Tseng
Where's AERIS? Isn't she with you?
Tseng
Oh… Then give her my regards.
Tseng
AERIS… Long time no see.
Tseng
Looks like you're safe from the Shinra for a while, now that Sephiroth reappeared.
What are you saying? That I should be grateful to Sephiroth?
Tseng
No…
I won't be seeing much of you, so take care.
Tseng
Well then, stay out of Shinra's way.
AERIS isn't with us. She's with the others.
Wh, who are you!?
By any chance, are you…?
Who are you?
… I hoped I'd never see you again…
Sir!
Elena
Mr. Tseng!?
Tseng
No need to tell them about our orders.
Rude/Elena
Yes sir!
…Strange, hearing that from you.
Elena
Oh! Right!
Tseng
…Elena. You don't seem to understand.
Elena
Oh!> I'm, I'm sorry…
Tseng
…Go. Don't let Sephiroth get away.
Elena
Very well, Rude and I will go after Sephiroth, who's heading for Junon Harbor!
Base of Fort Condor
We've been fighting the Shinra on this battlefield for a long time.
We've still settled in for a long war with them.
Could you spare some time, and help us fight them?
We don't want to sound pushy, so if you're busy with something, why don't you finish that first?
Where is Junon?
We'll help you
We don't want to sound pushy, so if you're busy with something, why don't you finish that first?
Like to help but…
I guess we'll help
We don't want to sound pushy, so if you're busy with something, why don't you finish that first?
I'm sorry…really
All right, we'll help
Let's see…head north along the coast, keep going a ways and you'll run into Junon.
But be alert because it sits in the shadows of a small hill.
All right then… Take care of yourselves…
Really!? Then go on up and they'll fill you in on the details.
Entrance to Fort Condor
What happened?
Where are all the villagers?
God! What the hell happened here!?
He's still alive.
Where is everybody?
Where are we?
Oh good, they're still alive.
Oy! What on earth happened?
It seems we survived.
You mean to tell me we're the only ones who made it?
I couldn't do anything. It was just too much.
Damn!! I can't stand this!
Oh man… You look like hell.
I… I couldn't save anyone…
…not enough strength.
Well, I'm just glad we're all alive.
Things sure didn't go smoothly.
We might have underestimated the situation.
You mean to tell me that's the extent of my powers? So that's as good as it gets? At this rate I'll never beat the Shinra…let alone Sephiroth…
Yeah, ain't no way you gonna win.
But if we give up now, what's gonna happen to Fort Condor?
No, CLOUD. You mustn't give up. Survivors never give up.
CLOUD… You won't find the answer by blaming yourself.
Things are the way they are… But you can't blame yourself for that, right?
Don't be too hard on yourself, CLOUD. Let's think about what we should do next.
No use crying over spilt milk. Right?
Geez, you don't pull any punches do you? We'll just try not to fail next time.
We have to fight to avoid any more casualties.
We'll do it next time, OK?
Yeah.
They've had their fun, but it's over as of now! There isn't gonna be any more suffering.
CLOUD… What should I do?
TIFA…
…
CLOUD I wonder what's going to happen?
Y'know, worryin' only tires you out. Why don't you take it easy?
You've got no choice but to take it for now.
Oy, such a bitter pill to swallow.
This ain't no joke, Jack.
Oh man, this is real bad.
Things don't seem too favorable.
I told you I'm not kidding!
If this were a joke it'd be one thing, but this's the truth.
This is a rather harsh reality.
Fort Condor
Hello. I'm sorry but we're not selling anything now. We're using everything we have for ourselves.
Hello. Do your best. We will, too.
Sorry, but I can't sell you anything now.
You hang in there!
Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.
…Your eyes are different. Well, anyhow. Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra.
You'd better get down before you get involved.
Hmmn, now this is something, I never thought anyone would ever climb up here.
Any minute now, this will be a battlefield against Shinra. You'd better get down before you get involved.
Shinra? The hell those jackasses doing here?
You mean Shinra?
What do you mean, a battlefield'?
The Shinra…
Shinra again.
The Shinra? Here too?
…
What do you mean by that?
A battlefield? We can't overlook that.
It appears you have a problem with Shinra, too. After all, you climbed up here.
Why not listen to what I have to say for a moment?
…
I guess so
Not interested
Oh, by all means.
All right, talk on!
The hell you talkin' about!? They're all fightin' the Shinra too! You gonna ignore that!?
CLOUD, let's listen to what they have to say.
After all, we came all this way, CLOUD
I know, I know, CLOUD. But let's listen for a bit.
There's no harm in listening to them.
Is this about the jewels?
Man, she sure's cold.
Do you know what's at the top of this mountain?
Huh? Something's up there?
A huge bird.
Come on, let's get it together.
Look close, old man.
Yeah, come to think of it there was something.
The reactor and the Condor.
That's the reactor and the Condor.
That's the reactor and the Condor.
That's the reactor. And the Condor.
Come to think of it, there was a reactor. But I've never seen anything shaped like it…
No matter how you look at it, that's a reactor. And on top of it, is that the Condor?
I can see you're very perceptive. Yes, it's a reactor and a Condor.
That's right, on that mountain is a Condor and a reactor.
It seems the Shinra doesn't like the idea of having a Condor on top of the reactor.
Damn, that's one big bird! But why are they trying to get rid of it with weapons?
What's so wrong with having a Condor on top of the reactor?
Why?
It's not very logical.
The logic eludes me.
I'm certain there must be state-of-the-art Materia inside the reactor. Am I right?
…That's too much.
Huh? I don't get it.
Huh?…
It seems there's some type of special Materia in the reactor above us.
And because the Condor came, the Shinra rushed troops here.
The military wants to get the Condor and all the villagers off this mountain.
The Condor is now warming its egg, which hatches only once every few years.
We would like to protect the Condor from being harmed.
New lives…
I'll do it! I'll protect them from Shinra!
Condor's egg A real work of nature.
We've got to protect the life of the Planet.
We must protect the condor egg, right?
So, to protect the egg, are you gonna protect the reactor?
We're going to protect the reactor in order to save the egg.
Special Materia, huh? Well, well, things are getting interesting.
I'm gonna leave it up to you all.
…and come out in one piece?
You guys, what are ya gonna do?
Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to fight Shinra ourselves.
That's why we have hired soldiers to help us.
As our sponsor, you can help us with a contribution or by fighting alongside of us…
What do you think? You want to join us in our fight?
…
What's there to think about? We gotta do it!
CLOUD…
CLOUD, why are you still worrying about it?
You decide what we're going to do.
What are we going to do?
If things go right, we might even be able to pray to that special Materia.
I'll leave it up to you so please do as you see fit.
It's difficult to get back what you've lost…
Don't be so wishy-washy. Hurry and make up your mind.
…
All right
Not interested
What's wrong with you? And you call yourself a human!?
Well…
What a jerk. I'm disappointed in you.
Now we lost the Materia.
Have no regrets for what's already past.
If you've made up your mind, let's just do it.
CLOUD, thanks.
Everyone, listen to what I have to say.
I can't possibly leave these people like this.
Let's do whatever we can to help them. All right?
If you go that far, what can I say? Well, we'll be able to do something if you leave it up to us.
Hey! We'll come to the rescue.
Yes, yes. Let's do our best.
Right. Let me lend a hand, too.
Got it. I'm gonna lend a hand, too.
Okay, it's settled. We're gonna get the Materia, right?
Well then, let's do our best.
That's the right decision.
I see… Come back if you should change your mind.
Have you by chance changed your mind?
…
Well, let's do it
My position hasn't changed
Whew, we'll be saved.
Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about the details of our military tactics. We're depending on you.
Ask my son, who's standing guard at the shed, about anything related to our military tactics.
Yes, yes, I've also told the store owners about you, so they should sell you various items.
And feel free to use our beds.
I'm begging you. Please prevent the reactor from being destroyed and the Condor from being killed.
You've come at a good time. Shinra's changing its strategy now.
It seems that Shinra will destroy the reactor and then take out the Materia that's inside.
I see. I guess that means this area, too.
Well, we can't afford to lose any more.
Man, we're walking on dangerous ground. We can't lose now!
Now is the time to dig in.
We can't afford to be beaten!
We can't afford to be beaten!
If we lose here, all the Materia we gathered will be for nothing.
You're right. If we lose here, we'll be in great danger.
We must protect this area.
Damn! I guess we have to protect this area too.
Watch Room
Do you guys want to see it, too?
See what?
What?
What is it?
The condor. It's huge. Come on, have a look.
What do ya think? Awesome, huh?
So, will you help us? I don't want them to get killed.
They're gigantic birds and so striking. We simply can't let them be killed by man's selfishness.
Of course not. There's no way, especially by the Shinra.
If you want to see them, get on that chair over there.
Thanks for accepting.
So shall I let you in on our strategy?
The enemy has targeted our mountain reactor and will be climbing to reach it.
We must set a trap and hire soldiers to protect the place.
Well, this is all we have… This village doesn't have any money. Even if we wanted to fight, we can't because we're broke.
We need 400 gil to hire one soldier. So, if we hire 20 soldiers, we need 8000 gil.
We need to ask you to use your own money to hire these soldiers, buy the equipment, set it up and give the commands.
We know what we're asking is selfish.  We sent our wives and children to another village, But, we're resigned to stay.
Let's get back to basics. If the enemy reaches this shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately.
It's a one shot gamble but we're asking for your help.

If you don't have time could you help us with a donation?
If you donate the money, we can hire the soldiers and block Shinra's attack.
We know what we're asking is selfish. We sent our wives and children to another village, But, we're resigned to stay.
Let's get back to basics. If the enemy reaches this shed, you'll have to fight them off immediately.
It's not the end of the world, but if you lose repeatedly, it could be dangerous.
Now then, is there anything you wish to ask?
Conditions for victory
The enemy
Type of soldiers
Funding
Other
Enough
You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander.
If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to battle immediately.
If you lose, the Condor's life and ours…are over.
You can win by wiping out the enemy or killing the enemy commander.
If the enemy reaches the shed, they'll attack, and you'll have no choice but to battle immediately.
If you lose during direct contact, and even if the enemy gets to the reactor, there's still a chance to win.
But, it's only a slight chance, and we have no idea how much the reactor can endure in an attack.
When we can't defend against the attack any longer, the Shinra will take our lives, the Condor and all the Materia in the reactor.
We can't use the Tristoner or Fire Catapult, because they are still not ready.
The Fire Catapult is ready now, so we can set it up.
We can't use the Tristoner, because it is still not ready.
First off, we must prepare the troops.
Move the cursor wherever the x mark does not appear, then press [OK] to set-up.
After all positions are in place, press [CANCEL]. This starts the battle.
Soldiers can only be arranged near the shed, in the beginning.
That's because if the soldiers are too far away, they won't be able to follow instructions.
You can only put soldiers above the horizontal line at the very bottom.
Soldiers can be instructed by pushing [ASSIST]. So if any commands are unclear, push it.
Soldiers can report by pushing [OK]…
The cursor will move to the soldier who made the report.
Press [CANCEL] and you'll hear the report without moving.
And you can bet Shinra will send platoons at you on a regular basis.
It would be great if you could spare the time to help us…
But, if you really don't have time, would you contribute some financial assistance?
Hey, looks like they're getting ready to attack right now! Please, any help is appreciated…
Whew, that was good. But, Shinra's troops will be back.
Be sure and scout the area well… We don't know when they'll attack again.
My God! They're attacking! We're counting on you.
We made it through that one somehow. But, Shinra'll be back.
Be sure and scout the area well… We don't know when they'll attack again.
Are you all right? Looks like a few got through.
We have  allies left, so here's  gil.
We have 20 allies left, so we'll return 4000 gil to you.
Hey we're a little short on money… so could you at least make it  gil?
Hang in there, if we lose  more times, we're in deep trouble.
How are things going? Seems like there's no activity at Shinra.
Perfect timing! They're just around the corner. Get ready.
Wait
OK, ready
Contribute gil
Let them handle it
Hear more
Preparations ready?
Wait
OK, ready
Contribute gil
Let them handle it

Ready?
Wait
OK, ready

I see, very well then. Maybe, we'll fight together again sometime.
Sorry. We only have  gil. We have to beg for your help.
We have  gil right now.
We need 3000 gil for each battle.
How much can you help?
500 gil
1000 gil
2000 gil
3000 gil
5000 gil
Nothing right now
We are very grateful, but you don't have enough money.
Thanks. This makes gil.
That's enough money for now. If we run out, we'll ask you for more.
How goes it? The Shinra troops have attacked times since you were here.
So we're getting a little short on funds.
You're just a little too late… They attacked when you weren't here.
The situation has changed. Looks like the enemy is set to attack. If we lose here, it's over.
Our lives are in your hands. We're counting on you.
… Even if you could only spare them…
YES! We did it! That was wonderful! Thank you!! I doubt Shinra will attack now.
A, arrgghh…
There are four types of enemies.
Wyverns
Beasts
Barbarians
Commanders
Anything else?
Wyverns are flying types that can move at high speed. Stoner and Tristoner aren't effective against them.
Beasts are monster types that do not move quickly, but have explosive attacking power.
Barbarians are human types. They attack from a distance, so you've got to be on your toes.
Commanders are the enemy commanders. They're the ones we want to subdue, but they're formidable foes.
Your mobile allies are: Fighters, Attackers, Defenders, Shooters, Repairers and Workers.
Your immobile allies are: Stoner, Tristoner, Catapult, and Fire Catapult.
Which do you want to hear about?
Mobile types
Immobile types
Anything else
Which do you want to hear about?
Fighters
Attackers
Defenders
Shooters
Repairers
Workers
Anything else
Which do you want to hear about?
Stoners
Tristoners
Catapults
Fire Catapult
Anything else
Fighters are good at defending and attacking, but aren't especially effective or deficient for any enemy.
Attackers move extremely fast and are best for expanding the front line.
They work good against enemy Beasts, but not enemy Barbarians.
Defenders have high endurance, but move slowly. They're best suited for defense.
Defenders work best against enemy Barbarians, but not enemy Wyverns.
Shooters attack from a distance, but have low endurance.
Shooters work best against enemy Wyverns, but not enemy Beasts.
Repairers repair allied units, but have little attacking power.
Workers set mines. Mines have strong attacking power, but Workers don't.
Mines explode when touched by the enemy. The explosions will damage everything in the immediate area.
Stoners can fire a single boulder, causing extensive damage to every enemy it hits.
Tristoners can fire three boulders simultaneously, causing extensive damage to every enemy they hit.
Catapults shoot rocks a great distance, causing extensive damage to every enemy they hit.
Fire Catapults fire bombs a great distance, causing extensive damage to every enemy they hit.
You must pay for every weapon you set up. Even if you decide to move it later, you can only get back half of the gil you spent.
You have 10 enemies. There appear to be many Beasts, so you may want to deploy more Attackers.
The Barbarians are mixed during this attack.
There are more than 20. Set up for a balanced-attack or we'll be in trouble.
A strong unit's on their way. Looks like around 30.
They'll probably climb up here using various routes. Better be careful or we'll be in trouble.
And make sure to deploy Fire Catapults.
You're probably used to it now, but don't let your guard down.
Deploy Tristoners.
Looks like the enemy numbers 40. Don't let your guard down.
I think you don't need my advice. The rest is up to you.
This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever before.
Let's give them all the gil we have.
This is the deciding battle. The enemy numbers more than ever before.
Received " gil"!
Received "40,000 gil"!
Looks like there's a special Materia up in the Mako reactor.
Then came the Condor, so Shinra dispatched the troops to get rid of it.
Their plan is to get rid of the Condor and the people on this mountain and to get the Materia from the Mako Reactor.
Oh, it's you guys? How are things going?
Up to now, you've lost  times. If you lose too many times, you won't be able to come back.
…
We'll get some rest
Let's move on
Yeah…
Let's get some rest
Maybe next time
Yo!
Take a break
Not right now
Ey, let's get some rest.
Say, let's rest. Okay?
Let's rest. Okay?
We should get some rest while we can.
Let's take a break when we can afford to.
Come on… break time, break time!
Now, shall we get some rest?
It's probably best to get some rest now.
Come on, let's get some shut-eye.
Haa--ah! Gotcha! And you deserve it, too!
Hey, we been had! And…my money!
Hey! My money!
Hmm…Hey, don't we have less money than before?
… Some money is missing.
Hey! My emergency money!
Gil, gil, gil, where's my gil!?
What the--!? Gone! My money's gone!
Hmm? Pretty fast.
200 Gil Stolen!
500 Gil Stolen!
700 Gil Stolen!
1000 Gil Stolen!
&^%$!! Gimme back my money!!
Wait a second! Where's my money!?
Geez! You shouldn't have done that!!
Greed…A perfect example of human nature.
Give…give back what is rightfully mine!
Hey, you can't! My gil, give it back!
Steal MY money, will ya? You got a lot of #&^%$ nerve!!
Just remember who you're dealin' with, punk!!
The gil doesn't seem be her real objective…
Wassup with that broad?
CLOUD, do you know her?
Who is that girl?
You don't see one like that everyday…
Who is that girl? She's still a child.
Who do you think she is? I don't recognize her face.
Who is that kid?
She has a mysterious weapon. I've seen her somewhere before…
Man… I can't believe I lost.
You spikey-headed jerk! One more time, let's go one more time!
All right
Not interested
Hey, boobs! Try that again! Just one more time!
What did you say!?
Don't fight
Hey, you bow-legged ol' man! Give me another chance! I'll fight ya!
Give her a lickin'
Forget it!
I won't lose this time! Take your time and get ready. Holler when you're ready!
No way I'm going to fight with a punk like you more than once!
I'll save enough for the doctor bill! Next time, you won't be as lucky!
Thinkin' of running away? Stay and fight! FIGHT, I said!
C'mon… What's the matter?
You're pretty scared of me, huh!?
Petrified…
You're gonna lose again
C'mon… What's the matter?
You're pretty scared of me, huh!?
Petrified…
You're outta your league!
C'mon… What's the matter?
You're pretty scared of me, huh!?
Something like that
You're wasting your time
Wh…what!?
Uuuuugh! Now I'm really mad!
Make fun of me, will ya! Just watch!!
Hmm, just as I thought. What do you expect with my skills?
Good luck to you guys, too. If you feel up to it, we can go another around. Later!
She's gone… What's with her?
Gone… Wassup with that?
She's gone… So what was that all about?
She's gone… So what did that prove?
Huh? She's gone… What is she doing?
…She disappeared… I have no clue what happened.
She's gone, hey… What's with that kid!?
… What could her motivation have been?
What is it, you still have somethin' for me?
…Hmmm. So is that it?
I know you want my help because I'm so good!
You want me to go with you?
That's right
You kiddin'?
What, you still want somethin'?
Hmm… So is that it?
You want my help cause I'm so good!
You want me to go with you!? Is that what you're saying?
That's right
No way!
What is it, you still want somethin'?
…Hmm. So is that it?
You want my help cause I'm so good!
So you want me to come with you!? Is that what you're saying?
That's right
What're you sayin'?”
I'm gonna leave! I mean it!
Go ahead
Wait a second!
I'm really gonna leave! I mean it!
Yeah, so?
Wait a second!
I'm really gonna leave! I mean it!
GO, then!
Hold on!
Oh yeah? Then do whatever you want!
Heh heh…thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do?
But, if you want me that bad, I can't refuse…
All right! I'll go with you!
What's your name?
Let's hurry
Heh heh…thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do?
But, if you want me that bad, I can't refuse…
All right! I'll go with you!
What's your name?
Come on, let's hurry!”
Heh heh…thought so. You put me in a spot. Hmm, what should I do?
But, if you want me that bad, I can't refuse…
All right! I'll go with you!
What's your name?
Come on, or we'll leave you!
Me? The name's…
What are you talking about!? You're the one who should go first!
Okay forget it! I'm not going with you!
Remember, if you piss me off it'll cost you!!
Huh? Hey…HEY!
Wait! I haven't even told you my name…
I'm YUFFIE! Good to meetcha!
Heh, heh…just as I planned.
Now all I have to do is… a little this and a little that… nyuk, nyuk, nyuk…
Hey, wait up! Wait for me!!
Here, I'll give you back the money I've stolen from you!
…Or, uh, what's left of it.
Under Junon
What kinda place is this?
Did you see a man with a black cape?
Are you all right now?
That's all right.
Hey!!
Wait a second!
What happened to this town? It's so run-down…
What's that music? It sure sounds lively.
Rufus!? I gotta pay my respects.
We gotta get to the town up there… Mebbe we could climb the tower?
Yeah, I'd like to take a good look at the new President of Shinra, Inc.!
Seems like something's goin' on up there!
High voltage tower…
I guess this means CLOUD'll have to do it.
Don't you just hate this?
Doesn't it seem a little strange? Everything getting so noisy all of a sudden?
Maybe…he dropped some from the North Caves into the Lifestream…
Sir, do you know where the Lifestream runs through?
CLOUD might have drifted from there.
You think Rufus is thinking about crossing the ocean from here, too?
What? Does that mean Sephiroth already crossed the ocean?
Yeah, better leave it to CLOUD!
You're probably right.
I heard that girl regained consciousness.
CLOUD, didn't you finish Rufus off?
We're counting on you, CLOUD.
That looks like a Shinra soldier.
Does this have something to do with the Shinra?
Aren't you going to follow her?
What's this loud music? It's giving me a headache!
Priscilla
Umm…thanks for helping…
Priscilla
I'm sorry, I mistook you for one of those Shinra, Inc….
Priscilla
I heard they're rehearsing the reception for the new Shinra president.
Priscilla
Grandpa and Grandma told me this beach was beautiful when they were small.
But after the Shinra built that city above, the sun stopped shining here, and the water got polluted…
I was raised on that story and hate Shinra so much, I could die!
Priscilla
No! No! There's a high voltage current running underneath the tower. Don't wander near it, it's dangerous!
Priscilla
But…you might be able to if Mr. Dolphin helps you. Follow me!
Priscilla
I'll give you something SPECIAL!
It's an amulet. Take good care of it, OK?
It's at my house, so come by later to pick it up, OK?
If you want to get on the elevator that badly, give me 10 gil!
Okay, I guess
No way!
Hurry up and get in!
You're such a cheapskate.
HEY! This is Shinra, Inc.'s elevator. Don't be snooping around here!!
What? It's not time for our shift, yet. Just relax.
That's not enough! Can't let you get on…
Uh…yeah…
Who are you people? Where did you come from?
Hmm… I've never seen that feller before.
There's nothing here now… But it used to be a busy port.
Sorry, CLOUD. Priscilla needs to rest for a while.
I just saw some Shinra soldiers all huddled together discussing something.
They said a plane carrying Huge Materia would be taking off from the airport above.
I remember years ago, seein' the Shinra build a long pipe underwater.
The underwater reactor is connected to Junon by a pipe. You should be able to get to the reactor through it.
What? CLOUD is missing?
What? The Northern…what? Sorry, but I don't think I follow.
But…I think I remember hearing Priscilla saying 'Life…something' before.
I think I've heard Priscilla mentioning 'Life…something' before.
Listen CLOUD, I'm over the hill, but Priscilla is still a child.
Isn't there a way to protect at least her from Meteor?
Ever since…Shinra built that city up above during the war…ugh, ugh.
There's been no fish in the water! It got so polluted…phew…
It seems like there's something going on again up there.
Is that huge plane going to take off again with that deafening roar?
I don't think I'll ever…cough… …live to see things… …beautiful again.
Once Meteor hits, not just the fish, but the whole ocean will be destroyed…
There's a dolphin in the bay. If you get close enough and blow the whistle, it might come to you.
If you want to get on the ship, why not have the dolphin take you?
Wow, now this is rare. We almost never have anyone other than the Shinra people visit this town.
I know you guys want to go to the Western Continent, but the only way is on a Shinra ship.
Hey, come in for a while.
For the past few decades, the only thing I've been hearing about is the Shinra.
I miss the times when we used to talk only about fish…
I almost passed out when I saw Weapon.
I heard Weapon was beaten, but a Shinra soldier told me there are 4 more.
They say Shinra's gathering Huge Materia from around the world and bringing it to Junon.
Bringing it to Junon must mean they want to use their airplanes.
I've noticed there's been a lot of Shinra ships recently. I think they're going to the Junon Underwater Reactor.
Isn't Shinra trying to transport the Reactor's Huge Materia?
I heard a war's about to start! And that's why they're moving the big cannon!
Could be the end of the world…
Weapon Store
Hmm, what?
If you see a weapon you want, you'd better buy it.
Dolphin Offing
…That's how it is.
Great…
Hey! Hold on, we're coming!
A gift? What am I supposed to do with it!?
Jump to the top of the pole?
No! You got it all wrong! We're fighting against the Shinra!
Hey! Look at that!
Now ain't that something! I ain't never seen no dolphin jump like that!
Good luck CLOUD! If you make it, we'll follow you!
Whoa, I'll hold the PHS for you. It'll break if it gets wet.
No…stay calm…
Look at that!
No you're wrong! We have nothing to do with the Shinra.
What's that!?
We don't get along with the Shinra.
Hey! It's a monster!
Hey watch your mouth! We hate the Shinra!
Whoa, Gawd!
He-y! Mr.Dolphin!
Priscilla
Who are you guys? Are you members of Shinra, Inc.?
Priscilla
I don't believe you! Get out of here!
Priscilla
Be careful, Mr.Dolphin!
Priscilla
Wait a minute.
Priscilla
Pretty cool, huh? When I blow this whistle, Mr. Dolphin jumps for me.
Here!! This is for you, CLOUD!
Just go into the water, blow this whistle, and Mr. Dolphin'll jump you to the top of the pole!
See that rod sticking out at the top? If you jump just right, you can climb to the top of the town.
You wanna jump with Mr. Dolphin?
Explain it to me again
Sure
I'll pass
Priscilla
Come back whenever you want to see Mr. Dolphin!
Priscilla
There's high voltage running through the bottom of the tower. Don't go near it…
My name is… Pri-scil-la! Now you say it.
Priscilla
Did you drown? It gets deeper the farther you go out.
[SWITCH]  Blow the whistle to call the dolphin.
Jump up to the cargo ship on the dolphin?
Yes
No
Dolphin Offing
This is bad… You don't think she's dead, do you?
Mouth to mouth!?
But… she's just a girl…
Guess I gotta do it…
C'mon CLOUD.
CLOUD, what are you going to do?
CLOUD, hurry!
You know I can't.
Do it, CLOUD!
Priscilla
Uh…ugh…
Priscilla!!
Nope…she's not breathing…
OK, help her…
Young man, do CPR!
What? You don't know how? Come over here, I'll show you.
Just take a deep breath, hold it in. Then breathe into her.
Understand?
Once more
Got it
Hurry up and do it!
Hey hey! Priscilla, are you alright?
That's still not enough!
What are you doing? Hurry up! Breath deeply and give her mouth to mouth!
Push [SWITCH] once to start the CPR gauge.
Push it again to stop the gauge.
Grandma's House
Yeah…
We'll try later
Let's rest
TIFA…
When Sephiroth and I went to Nibelheim, where were you?
The other time.
Hmmm…
Let's get some rest
No time to rest
Get some rest?
CLOUD, come here. Everyone's here.
…We saw each other, right?
No…it was 5 years ago. I don't remember.
But, something seems strange outside. CLOUD, come quick.
Want to rest?
What are you thinking?
I'm gonna relax for a while.
Shall we rest?
Wanna rest?
I heard what happened. You've done so much for Priscilla.
You all must be tired. If you want to get some rest, stay here.
Make yourselves at home.
…That reminds me
You again?
…Who are you?
…You'll find out soon. …But more importantly, 5 years ago…
5 Years ago…Nibelheim?
When you went to Mt. Nibel, TIFA was your guide, right?
Yeah, …surprised me.
But where was TIFA other than that?
…I dunno.
It was a great chance for you two to see each other again.
…You're right.
Why couldn't you see each other alone?
…I don't know. I can't remember clearly…
Why don't you try asking TIFA?
…Yeah.
Then, get up!
Hey, wake up. Wake up, CLOUD!
Priscilla's House
No…that tickles…
No…Stop…
Mr. Dolphin…
Priscilla
Who are you?
At least knock when you enter a lady's room!
Priscilla
Lifestream?
Yeah, I know! It's Mr. Dolphin's playground.
There's a Three-taloned island south of the continent. I heard the Lifestream runs below that island.
But why are you asking about the Lifestream?
Priscilla
Huh, CLOUD!?
Hurry up and help him!! He's very important to me.
Priscilla
CLOUD!!
Stupid jerk! Look how much you made me worry!! Were you at the Lifestream?
Priscilla
You've gotta be more careful! Because you're going to marry me one day.
Priscilla
I'm so happy!! Someday I'm going to be CLOUD's wife.
Priscilla
I've decided I'm gonna be CLOUD's wife.
Yeah, that's right.
CLOUD fell into the Lifestream at the North Cave, and has been missing ever since.
We found CLOUD!
Received "Shiva" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia. Please discard some Materia.
Dolphin Offing

It's the Shinra uniform.
Don't change
Change
There's Shinra soldiers all around. Better not try anything dumb…
Brings back memories…
A Shinra uniform…
I was so proud when I first put it on.
I wonder when it was…
…I couldn't stand wearing this thing anymore.
Wow! You look good in it!
You remember the greeting procedure, right!?
…The look on your face says you forgot. All right, I'll show you again!
Do just like I do.

So-so.

They just shot up!!

I want somebody to send that soldier an expensive gift.

We did it!
Send that soldier something special.

What!? You're FIRED!!
Send that soldier a bomb or something!

What happened to the Airship?
Heidegger
The long range airship is still being prepared.
It should be ready in about three more days.
It should be ready in about three more days. Rufus
Even the Air Force's Gelnika?

Gya haa haa!
Rufus
Stop that stupid horse laugh.
Things are different than when Father was in charge.
Heidegger
Gya…
Rufus
Is the ship ready?
Heidegger
Yes Sir, we'll get it ready quickly.
What a disaster.
Heidegger was really irritated…
The man in the Black Cape's been roaming the city, but we can't find him.
Man in a Black Cape?
He showed up two or three days ago, and killed a few of our soldiers.
He disappeared right after that. There's a rumor going around that it was Sephiroth.
Attention! Dismissed!
Hey! Hey you! You messing with the army?
Who cares?
What if I am?
You're too lazy!! No break for you!!

Oh, a Soldier! Welcome!
Oh, welcome!
They're not going to get me down! Not me!! Weapon, Meteor, even bad customers, aren't going to get me!
Materia Store
Please! Come in…
Welcome!
No charge for a smile…
Buy a lot, cutie!
Please go to the counter.
Thank you very much!
There're lots of stores in Junon.
If we don't do this…we can't compete.
But, what bothers me is that the girls make more than me.
I hired more girls after hearing that the world's coming to an end, but I wonder if I should have.
I keep getting more and more in debt. I've got to get out from under it somehow. Maybe I'll have Weapon help me.
Look, why not forget about Meteor and Weapon for now and do a little impulse shopping!?
Why don't you surround yourself with young girls and have some fun…maybe for the last time.
Materia Store
Welcome!
I was just starting to get worried… You see our sales were pretty bad today.
Welcome!!
I just can't believe it. I never thought a monster like Weapon really existed.
Weapon Store
I've got nothing to sell to you! Come back later!
Hey! Yo! You want weapons?
Hey! Yo! Our weapons are the best!
Hey! Yo! Wanna buy the whole store?
This machine hasn't been working right ever since Weapon got to it!
Weapon Store
Oh! Welcome! We don't have much of anything now. I forgot to order enough the last time but feel free to look around!
Weapon was really something. No one can compare with his strength. But with a selection like this, our weapons could beat him.
Item Store
I used to be in SOLDIER… Afterwards, I opened this shop…
But to tell you the truth, I'd rather be at the shop downstairs.
I used to be in SOLDIER. Lately, I've felt like dressing up like this…
I know it's out of season, but…
Shinra Member's Bar
Hey G.I. Joe, aren't you still on duty?
Tseng
Stay outta this.
Reno
The President is safe because we're here.
Elena
Just when I think the job's boring, you guys start messing around.
I'm sorry. The bar is only for Shinra employees.
Mommy… My mommy…
I'm a good lookin' man once I take my uniform off.
Booze, booze! Ain't nothing like booze when you're on the clock.
I'm sorry. I'm closing this place down.
All my regular customers were killed by Weapon.
Most of them were pretty weird, but I had good memories of them.
Bar
Looks like something's going on outside, but we're too smashed to do anything…
Ooh, oohh… Oh man, my head's burning up…
I'm sorry! It's all rented out today!
The Shinra people are having a party tonight, and we're all booked up.
Seems like you're all a little too young to be in here.
Rude
Hmm? You too?
Then, take your mask off and come here. That's our rule.
Seaweed… Seaweed…
It just isn't a party without Rude!
Weapon and Meteor scared everyone else off, but I'm sittin' here soused as usual.
I'd like to close down this shop, but we got the regulars to think about. I don't know what to do…
Barracks
Hey, how could they do that!? Nobody woke me up!
And I can't find the uniform I left in my locker, either. I wonder where I forgot it?
Geez! Do you think this is what they call 'hazing?'
Oh man, My future in the military is pretty bleak.
Ever since I was late to that parade, they've been on my back everyday with basic training.
I can't handle it anymore!
Hey!! Stay out of the way!
Hey! Stop yappin'!
Hmm? A know-it-all, huh?
All right!! Come in!!
Hmmm? No rookies!!
Only veterans can go through! Come back when you've grown up.
Hmmm? You have no right to enter!
Hmmm? Back again, Mr. Know-it-all!?
All right! You can enter!!
I'm starting to feel like I can't stop anymore.
I've been had!! I want to get in a real battle, too!
Barracks
Received "Mind Source"!
Received "Luck Source"!
Received "1/35 soldier"!
Barracks
Mmm? I'm not going to the parade.
The road to becoming SOLDIER First Class is very difficult.
Don't mind me.
As a man with promise and future, I don't have any time to fool around like the rest of you.
Ugh…My eyes are tired… No, I've got to really buckle down!
At least until I become SOLDIER First Class.
…grrrrgh…grrrgh…
…zzzz…
Most of my rivals died in the attack on Weapon.
Oh, of course, I was here, studying.
That coveted green officer's uniform is almost in my reach.
Then I'll be on the newspapers as a plain clothed First Class officer in SOLDIER…
Then make a triumphant return to my homeland!! Tons of fan letters… My future's peachy!
Received "Power Source"!
Received "Guard Source"!
Barracks
Hey! Aren't you still on duty!?
Look, I shouldn't talk, but…
Don't become a bad worker like me.
These barracks are for soldiers. This is no place for civilians.
All the real soldiers died fighting Weapon.
Kind of ironic that losers like me are still alive. But that's the reality of it.
I'm trying to be a bad soldier!!
I just can't get the hang of it! This just isn't going right!!
Received "Speed Source"!

Shinra Manager
This is so embarassing!
…and they told me I would be staying at five star hotels on these trips…
Shinra Manager
How can you guys sleep in a place like this?
Shinra Manager
I only came to help transport the Sister Ray from Junon…
But now the company says don't bother coming back…
Is this what happens to a loyal Shinra man?
Shinra Manager
Hee Haaaw…
If Weapon killed all the upper management… then I'll be President!!
Received "1/35 soldier"!
Respectable Inn
This is a Respectable Inn… guests only!
You should absorb all the wisdom until it is a part of you.
OK, Mr. Know-it-all, ex-SOLDIER! Let me revenge…I mean, review!
What do you want to review?
ATB
Onscreen numbers
Change and Defend
Escape
Gauges
Status
Elementals
Help
That's all
I'm not so low as to take money off a bunch of low-lifes like you. I'm just doing this to kill time.
ATB means Active Time Battle. It's a system in which time continuously runs during battle.
If the ATB is changed to [WAIT] in the Config Menu… Time stops during battle while you select magic or an item.
That lets you select your commands carefully. It's geared especially for beginners like you.
In the Config menu, if you change from ATB to [Recommended]…Time will stop while magic or item effects are displayed.
This lets you watch the effects carefully. Letting you fight at your own pace… this is the way to go.
I always use ACTIVE mode, but choose what you want. That's all.
During a battle, white numbers that appear on the screen indicate damage, and green numbers indicate recovery points.
Remember that, if you don't want to be Wiped Out.
Change will change your fighting position to either the front or back row.
If you select the back row, the amount of damage you receive is reduced, but so is your attacking power.
[Change] can be selected from the battle menu by pushing the [left Directional button].
You can also select [Defend] from battle menu by pushing the Directional button to the right.
Defend will reduce your damage by half until your next turn.
It's better to use Defend for strong enemies. Of course, I don't need anything like that.
I don't know too much about Escape during battles since I never do it, but…someone like you might need it.
You can escape by holding down [PAGEUP] and [PAGEDOWN] in battle.
It might be hard to understand this next one since you can't check it right now, but just listen.
I'm talking about the Gauges displayed during battle.
The Time Gauge shows the time remaining until your next turn during battle.
You can enter a command once the Gauge is full, but if you don't want to enter a command, press [MENU] to skip to the next person.
This is good when you want to make BARRET work.
The Limit Gauge increases as you receive damage. When this is full, you are able to use a Limit Technique.
The Limit Gauge doesn't reset after each battle, so it will build up the more damage you get in battle.
The trick is knowing when to use it instead of using it as soon as it becomes available.
You may already know this, but I'll tell you anyways. Status has two conditions:  Fury and Sadness.
Fury speeds up your Limit Gauge, but decreases your concentration.
Sadness slows down your Limit Gauge, but also decreases the damage you receive. Keep this in mind.
The Barrier Gauge shows the time available for special magic effects.
The top gauge, Barrier, defends against attacks. And the bottom gauge, Magic Barrier, defends against magic spells.
Both reduce the amount of damage by half, but disappear after several uses.
Always keep an eye on the Barrier Gauge, when using Barrier and Magic Barrier spells.
That's all. Check them out next time you're in a battle.
If you don't understand what I just told you, I guess you just have a limited capacity for information.
But, relax. Push [ASSIST] during battle.
A Help Message should explain the different commands to you.
It'll tell you things like the monsters' names. Even I look at it, sometimes… so don't be ashamed to use it.
Wiped Out… I've never really seen it, but someone told me about it once.
When you get Wiped Out, you can continue from your last Save Point. Your Experience points will not change.
Even wimps like you should be able to get out of difficult areas as long as you fight steadily. You ought to be thankful for this.
Status simply means the status of the characters.
I don't want to repeat myself too much, so I'll mention the main points.
Sleep Cannot enter command until awakened.
Poison Rapidly decreases HP during battle.
Fury Doubles damage, reduces concentration. Tranquilizer cures it.
Sadness Reduces damage. Hyper cures it.
Petrify Turns you into stone. If entire party is petrified, you'll get Wiped Out.
Confusion You cannot distinguish between enemy and ally.
Silence You cannot cast any Magic.
Paralysis Time Gauge stops, you cannot enter commands.
Darkness Reduces attack concentration.
Frog Turns you into a frog. I hate this.
Phew…I'm tired.
Changed Status can be changed with magic and items, so always double check it when you buy things.
Elementals are special Materia that come with magic and weapons.
You have to use this to your advantage in battle. Only once you start thinking in terms of Elementals can you truly be called an intermediate player.
Here are some examples. Remember, they're just examples. You don't have to memorize them.
Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.
Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.
Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.
Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.
Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison-based enemies.
Gravity Gravity-based attack. These hurt if they hit.
Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.
Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.
Holy Summons the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.
Using opposite Elementals often is effective in battle.
Using the same Elementals usually increases Defense. But, the reverse is also true. Watch out for it.
To find out what Elementals an enemy has, you need Sense Materia. Once you get it, try it out.
This is the Beginner's Hall (Intermediate)!
Your explanations were so complicated I couldn't return to the Planet.
So, I have a right to ask you again.
What do you want to know?
How to save?
How do I cure party members?
Curative Magic
Weapons and armor
How to apply Materia
Effective ways to use Materia
Battle formation

Limit Techniques

You got nothing to teach me!
For my explanation, I'll need a Potion.
Man, ex-SOLDIERs sure are cheap. OK, I'll GIVE you a Potion…
I don't seem to have any on me. Why don't you go buy one?
Thanks. I'll take that as my pay.
I think you know the basics, but just in case…
Do not open the CD drive or change discs until instructed.
If you open the drive, I can't guarantee anything. That is all.
OK wise-guy, I'll ask about Materia just so you can let off some stress.
You're right…
Growth Materia
Kinds of Materia
Combinations of Materia
Divisions of Materia
Number of Materia you may carry
The rest is a secret
First off, the main points.
Some types of Materia, like Magic, grow as you use them.
Some, like Summon Magic, grow from being used once a battle, to several times per battle.
Their effectiveness changes, too. There are all different kinds.
Some types don't change, but they must grow in order to be divided.
…And that's it. Maybe that sounded too official.
Types of Materia… Here goes!
[Independent Materia] enables Abilities. No linking required.
[Support Materia] is used with Command, Magic, and Summon Materia.
You must equip them in linked slots or they won't be any good.
[Command Materia] lets you use new commands.
There are lots of different kinds of Materia, so you'll never get bored. One called [Attack] changes itself.
[Magic Materia] is easy. You can use Magic, and as your Level increases, you'll learn new Magic.
[Summon Materia] let's you use Summon Magic. As your Level increases, the number of times you can use it in a single battle increases.
This's one of my favorites.
And there you have it, the five types of Materia.
There's no single way to combine Materia. So here goes the basics.
Support Materia… The basic combination is Magic + All.
The variety of magic you can cast will increase as your Magic Level increases.
When your All level increases, so does the number of times you can use it in a battle.
That about covers it.
Huh? Wait a sec…
You can change between Magic-All and Magic with [PAGEUP/PAGEDOWN]. I'll bet you've probably already done this.
One effective combination is Elemental + Summon Materia.
If you equip this combination to your weapon, you can put Magic and Summon Elementals on your weapon.
For example, if you equip Fire + Elemental to your sword, you will end up with Fire Elemental Sword.
I'm getting off the subject,… If you equip Fire + Elemental to your armor, it will have twice the resistance to fire damage.
Now this is important.
When the Elemental levels in your armor increase, so will their effectiveness. From half damage - no damage - absorb.
If you combined Elemental and Fire you could develop Fire absorbing armor.
Wait, there's more. Next is the Added Effect for Support Materia.
The Added Effect Materia grafts the effects of Compound Status Materia into your weapons and armor.
For example, equip Added Effect + Poison to your weapon and select [Attack]. Sometimes you'll make a Poison attack.
Of course, it doesn't always work.
If you don't combine the Added Effect Materia with Status Change Materia, like Confusion or Time, you won't get any effect.
To learn more about Added Effect, access the menu and check the Status.
It's a little hard to get, but if you take your time, you'll be all right.
Division… I'm pretty good at this.
People tell me that my personality is divided. But I don't think so, but maybe it is?
Anyhow…
Once your Materia reaches the maximum level, it will divide.
The original Materia will no longer grow. Once that happens, all you can do is use it as it is.
New Materia always starts out with zero AP, so you need to raise its levels!
Of course, once the new Materia reaches its max, it'll divide. That's how you increase your Materia collection.
Ha, ha… Right now I feel like I'm dividing myself.
Once Materia starts dividing, you must be careful.
There's a limit to how much Materia you can have.
Since we're fighting for the life of the Planet, it goes against my beliefs to carry too much Materia.
Either way, I don't really care but, I'll leave it up to you.
That's why, the amount of Materia that we can have is limited to 200… only what we can equip.
When you have too much Materia, you need to dispose of some. If you don't, you can't take on any more.
So, ditch some Materia before that happens… Ahem…I mean, give them back to the Planet.
OK. Expert! Enlighten us on Limit Techniques, why doncha?
I don't have too much to say about that…
Developing Limits
Extreme Limits
That's it
There are 2 basic ways of building up your Limit techniques. First, just use them!
And second is to finish off as many enemies as possible! It sounds easier than it is.
Everyone knows that when you gain a new Limit technique, you need to select it in the menu.
And you know that you won't be able to use advanced techniques on each level if you haven't used the basic ones.
Since the type and growth for each limit techniques is different, that's about all I will say.
A long time ago I heard extreme techniques exist within the Limit techniques.
But, if that's true you wouldn't be able to get it in any normal way. That's about all I know about it.
Received "Enemy Skill" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Junon Path
What is it? The elevator's out of order for an inspection.
You know, right under us is a Submarine Dock and the Underwater Mako Reactor.
Mako energy puts a lot of wear and tear on the machinery.
A lot of problems can pop up. So it's necessary for close inspections and maintenance.
Hey!! Civilian!! Stay out of our training!!
Go around them! And stay out of their way!!
All right!! Let's see how hard you trained!
Attention! Charge!!
He…hey!! That's the Underwater Reactor!! Come back!!
Our forces are in the process of gathering the Huge Materia from the Corel and the Fort Condor Reactors!
Once these two missions are completed, the Underwater Reactor will be our next target!
Till then, we do nothing but train, train, train!
Lower Junon
Lower Junon
Oh! How's it going!? If you're looking for Junon dock, it's over there!
This lift goes to the Shinra section.
Ever since that Black-caped murderer… But we can't use it because we're all on red alert.
Lower Junon
Need a heli-taxi? Only in Junon!
Free to Air Force personnel!
Sure
Nope
Roger!! Hey! Taxi!!
Just holler when you want a ride!
But if you get airsick easily, maybe you'd better not go.
Where to?
Next sector
Outside Junon
Right! The next sector it is!!
Then outside Junon it is! Take care!!
Junon Dock
All right, it's time!
Ten…HUT!
President Rufus…has now arrived!
This is it!! Junon Military Reception!
Do it right! Do it with enthusiasm! Ready…!
All right! Now finish strong!!

Rufus
Very entertaining. Keep up the good work.
Rufus
Looks like you need more practice.
With things looking this bad, you better get ready for cutbacks.
Rufus
Well done.
Keep up the good work for Shinra, Inc.
Heidegger
Gya haa ha!! Here's a special bonus for you!!
A token of the President's kindness! Don't forget it!
Received "Force Stealer"!

Rufus
Once the word gets out that Sephiroth's here, CLOUD and his friends will show up, too.
Heidegger
We'll crush them as soon as we find them!
Rufus
We can't have them get in our way.
Heidegger
Leave it up to me, sir! Gya haa ha!
Rufus
I thought I told you to stop that stupid laugh.
Heidegger
Gya…
All right! Dismissed!
That was close.
Heidegger's been really edgy lately.
Because Hojo disappeared, leaving a letter of resignation.
Heidegger's been forced to take over that investigation, too.
Hey! I thought you were dismissed!
We got some cleaning up to do! Hurry up!
Hey, hurry. You're the last one.
How did you get here?
A dolphin gave me a ride.
Priscilla remembered it after you climbed the pole. But don't be mad at her.
We'll cross the ocean, to the new continent.
…even if we are wearing Shinra's uniforms…
Lately the economy seems to be improving. Must be the 'Rufus' effect.
Cargo ships are always coming and going from Costa del Sol.
I'll forget you're being stowaways, if you help with the cargo.
Junon Dock
Everyday there's no ship coming in, I always come here to watch the sun go down.
The sun disappears like it's being swallowed up by the big horizon.
And somewhere out there is a big unknown continent with another port city.
Twilight always gets me misty…
I'm so glad I became a seaman.
I haven't had a girlfriend in 18 years. And I'm a romantic! …geez.
Well…I wouldn't have time for one now anyway because of Weapon…
Cargo Ship
Urrrgh… This is why…I hate ships.
Hey, CLOUD. You have any 'Tranquilizers'?
Here, use this
Nope
Thanks… Gross…this is bitter.
…Unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Ugh, you don't have any?
…Unless it's an emergency get away from me.
Where are the others?
I dunno. Aren't they hiding somewhere around here?
How should I know…?  Ugh…urk…
…the Engine Room… …a suspicious…character…
No…there's no way… that…not a human… That thing's not human.
…
Hey, get to work!
Both the new President Rufus and Heidegger are aboard this ship!
If we do good, we could get promoted!
Umm…It's me AERIS.
Hey, CLOUD. Did you see the Airship at Junon?
…I heard it was big, but I didn't expect it to be THAT big.
That was REALLY something.
Hey, do you think I could get on it?
I'll take you someday
I dunno…
…It's a Shinra weapon. We probably should've destroyed it.
…Hmm. But just once, I'd like to ride it.
Just once, I'd like to ride that Airship.
…Keep hoping.
Wow! I'm really looking forward to it!
Let's ride the Airship together, OK? Promise, promise me!
Hey, CLOUD. Did you see BARRET?
I hope he's not doing anything stupid…
It won't do any good trying to stop me!
All right! I'm going to show the new President what I'm made of!
Geez… What chance for a promotion.
The only one who's gonna benefit from this is the Chief, anyway.
It has nothing to do with us workers.
I'm workin' hard already, and you still want me to do more?
The new President's probably the same. He's just gonna order us around anyway.

Look, CLOUD. It's Rufus and Heidegger.
They're this close but we can't do a thing to 'em…
Ummmm… Gmmmmm…
How can he… Goin' off laughin' like that?
Because of him, Biggs, Wedge, Jessie…
Ggggggggh… Ggggh… Ggggggghhh!!
God!! I can't take it anymore!
I'm gonna settle things here and now!
Emergency alert! Reports of a stowaway found! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
I repeat… Stowaway sighted on board! Those not on detail, search the ship. Report when found!
Damn, did they find us!?
Hmm, I don't think it's us. Did they find TIFA and the others!?
Get off your spikey butt and let's go, CLOUD!
Cargo Ship
Yes sir! Everything quiet, sir!
…But, you know what? I really hate this uniform.
Uniforms, soldiers, war, I hate 'em all.
They take away all the things and people you love…
I wish they'd all disappear. Right, CLOUD?
Yeah…
I don't know
You're right!
Uh, yes sir, I'll continue my watch sir!  Hee hee…
…CLOUD. Wearing those clothes seems to have changed you a little.
Does it remind you of being in SOLDIER? I hope not…
Hey! What's wrong, kid? You got no pep!
A seaman's gotta have umph!
I'm tired…
Something's missing
Leave me alone
Say, who are you? You're not a part of the crew.
Oh well, seamen never bother with details!
How you feelin'!
I'm tired…
Something's missing
Leave me alone
Ey ey! Whattaya mean, 'missin'!?
I got just the perfect thing! Invisible Alpha'-- A super drink for seamen!!
Just one'll rejuvenate you! Only 250 gil!
I'll take it
No thanks
Thanks! This is a necessity for a sailor.
This is a must item for a sailor! Ha ha ha !
Thanks! Now let's get on with it!
This is the only real ecstasy you can get on this ship! Ha ha ha!
HP/MP Restored!
Hey! Seamen shouldn't be so stingy!
President Rufus and his men are in the Bridge of the Ship. If they see you slacking, they'll bust you one!
… …It's me. RED XIII.
I'm a little woozy, but I shouldn't get caught.
Humans only look at appearances anyway.
Anyway you look at it, I'd say I make a fine human being.
It's pretty hard standing on two feet…
Oh man, we're almost to Costa del Sol.
When I get there, I'm going to take a long overdue vacation. Maybe I'll go down to the beach and get a tan…
Hey! You don't have enough money!
You all right!?
Everyone all right!?
Huh?
Hey, wait.
You don't think that suspicious stowaway is…
Everyone's here…right?
Sephiroth!?
Really!?
How the hell am I supposed to know!?
…Let's find out.
It's the most logical thing to do.  Then, who's going to go?
N, not me…
I don't even like Sephiroth anyway. And besid…ugh…urk…
… Sephiroth…
…All right, let's go!
I'm goin' too!
Is it really Sephiroth…?
Take me with you!
These clothes are too tight on me. Can I switch with you?
I told you…I don't want… to, ugh…urk…

No…not Sephiroth!
…After a long sleep…
…the time…
…time has…come…
Look, CLOUD!!
Look, CLOUD!!
CLOUD, look!!
Over there, CLOUD.
Ov…over there!!
Sephiroth! You're alive!
Sephiroth
…Who are you?
You don't remember me!? I'm CLOUD!
Sephiroth
CLOUD…
Sephiroth! What are you thinking!? What are you doing!?
Sephiroth
…The time…is now…
What!? What are you saying!? Be more…
I've seen this somewhere…before.
I've seen this before…
Isn't he…that guy?
That's what disappeared from the Shinra building…
Eeeew! What IS it! GROSS!
…Jenova. The arm of Jenova.
Jenova…You mean he's been walkin' around with that thing?
Jenova… With this thing?
Jenova… He's been carrying this thing around?
Sephiroth took Jenova… What does it mean?
Gag… I'm sick enough as it is without you having to show me THAT!
So it WAS Sephiroth.
He said something about it being time for something.
The time is now… I think that was what was said.
He said the time is now.
The time is now? What does that mean?
He was mumbling something about time!
…Time…is now?
Dock workers--We will be docking in Costa del Sol in 5 minutes. Prepare for docking.
I don't know WHAT the hell's goin' on!
CLOUD, why don't you explain to me what's happened so far?
I'll try
No way
Hmm… I don't get it.
Hey, CLOUD. Can you explain it to us?
I'll try
Too much trouble
I'm getting so confused…
CLOUD, explain what's happened so far.
I'll try
Too much trouble
Hmm… The story's not that simple.
CLOUD, why don't you summarize what's happened so far?
I'll try
Too much trouble
So what's the story?
Hey CLOUD. Give us a quick run down.
I'll try
Too much trouble
…I'll try, but don't interrupt me while I'm explaining.
Sephiroth went off searching for the Promised Land, so he could become the ruler of the Planet… That was 5 years ago.
Then Sephiroth came back and killed President Shinra.
And then just now all of us saw Sephiroth.
He was carrying Jenova with him.
…This much I do know. He told me he wants to go to the Promised Land with his mother, Jenova.
…I guess that's about it.
Sephiroth… is alive…
The Promised Land… Does it really exist…?
Whoa! We'd best hurry and hide somewhere.
Maybe we shouldn't stay in here anymore…
We should hide somewhere again.
I don't think it's wise to stay here any longer.
Phew… We're finally here… Now we gotta hide.
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "Ifrit" Materia!
Costa del Sol Harbor
Damn! Sure is hot here!
But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.
Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
Oh, too bad. I liked BARRET's sailor suit. He looked so cute.
…What'ya mean 'cute'?
Right…well, uh…
BARRET, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?
Right, CLOUD?
I guess
Keep your mind on Sephiroth
Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.
I'm going on ahead.
Hmmph, CLOUD. You're the one who's always hangin' around wastin' time.
I'm going to skip this resort!
Ahhh… You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up!
…puff…puff…
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
Yeah, mine, too!!
All right. We'll take a break and then head off.
Don't wander too far off.
I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
It looks like my mane got messed up.
I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
I think I'll go swimming.
Sounds good to me!
Hmm? CLOUD, are you thinking of anything in particular?
Your cool exterior's cracking…
Well then, let's go!
Maybe I should get a tan for a change.
Which do you like, CLOUD?
I like fair complexions
Maybe a healthy tan is nice
Got it. I'll remember that.
Don't bother looking for me!
What a long boat ride that was!!
Rufus
Hmmm… Good work everyone…
Heidegger
Gya, Haa, haa…ha!! Hurry up with that!
Yes, sir!!
Rufus
I heard Sephiroth was on board.
Heidegger
Yes.
Rufus
And it seems CLOUD and the others were on board, too.
Heidegger
Yes.
Rufus
They all slipped through… You messed up big this time, Heidegger.
Heidegger
I'm ashamed of myself.
Rufus
Is that all you can do? Give one word answers and apologize for everything?
Rufus
Do something. I'll be expecting results.
Ready for departure, sir!!
Rufus
Very well then. That was fast.
You're outstanding. I'll remember you.
YES, SIR!! Thank you, sir.
Rufus
Remember Heidegger, You're allowed only one mistake.
I'm the boss!
But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand.
On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever… Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna.
It's the ultimate high!
He's quite handsome, isn't he?
Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond… He even looks good in a double-breasted suit.
Heh, heh… I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.
Heh, heh! Got nothing to do with us, does it?
Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!
Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head!
Da plane, da plane!! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime.
So you just watch from a distance… and wish.
Costa del Sol…a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round!
Hmm…Things aren't going well… You can go sightseeing in the city.
You're stowaways, right?
It's okay. I'm used to them.
The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.
Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President.
It seems like he's here on business this time.
I'm so jealous of him I could spit. We're both about the same age but he's President.
Oh crap… The manager of Shinra won't come down.
Even though the President's here on business. All he does is play, forgetting everything to do with work.
Rufus complimented me on my job!
Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.
Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!
Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship.
That's tough for both of us.
Ride the Shinra ship?
Yeah, I could go for that
Don't think I could steer it
Oh…is that so?
Yep! Actually, we do have an old junker we're gonna get rid of, And I was thinking about going into the tourist business.
But it's probably tougher than it looks I better think this through a little more…
Yeah. It's too much for an amateur!
Shinra manager
Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!
I mean it, I'm really gonna quit!!
Shinra manager
Heidegger's such an idiot!!
And Rufus, acting all big!!
Shinra manager
God, that sure felt good…
The transport ship won't be sailing for quite awhile. Heidegger's orders.
Thinking of being stowaways?
It's 100 gil to Junon. Give it to me, and I'll put in a good word with the captain.
What'll we do?
Pay up
Don't do it
Thank you. Come back any time you want to stowaway on our ship.
Hey! No money? And you're trying to stowaway? Don't make me laugh!
Okay. Come on. This way.
It's not the most pleasant ride but make the best of it.
Ever since Rufus complimented him, he strutted around for awhile, and haven't heard a peep from him since…
Today's a great day for a nap in the sun. It always puts me in a good mood!
Hey, who're you? You look like you've been around the world twice.
I don't know what your story is, but hang in there.
Everyone's in a rush to get one last vacation in before the Meteor strikes. That's why it's so busy here.
There's no ship to Junon. Recently, there's been a hoard on materials. Everything's topsy-turvy.
Not gonna be able to nap like this for much longer.
When you put it that way, I feel kind of sad.
Well, I'm not worried. When it all comes down, I'm heading for the skies.
The only problem is… will there be anywhere left to land?
Costa del Sol harbor
Damn! Sure is hot here!
But I sure am glad I can get rid of that damn sailor suit.
Yo listen up!! Make sure to mingle like regular folks here!
Oh‚too bad. I liked BARRET's sailor suit. He looked so cute.
What'ya mean 'cute'?
Right…well, uh…
BARRET, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?
Right, CLOUD?
Yeah‚maybe…
Concentrate on Sephiroth
Remember‚this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.
I'm going on ahead.
Hmmph‚CLOUD. You're the one, who's always hangin' around wastin' time.
I'm checkin' this place out!
Ahhh… You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be more comfortable, so shu'up!
…puff…puff…
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
Yeah‚mine‚too!!

Very well then. That was fast.
YES‚SIR!! Thank you‚sir.
Rufus
Remember Heidegger, Only one more mistake.
I'm the boss!
You'll never know what it's like to toil away on the ship.
Sailing over the blue sea, gazing up at a sky that seems to drift on forever. Feels like you're taking a nap on birds wings.
It's the ultimate high!
Handsome…isn't he?
Don't worry‚I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming‚rich‚blond… He even looks good in a suit.
Heh‚heh… I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.
Heh‚heh…! Got nothing to do with us‚does it?

House for Sale
CLOUD's Villa
What a fluffy bed! It feels so great
Mmm… five more minutes…
Huh!?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. This is so embarrassing.
Take your time and look around.
So are you seriously considering buying?
The heck do ya mean?
I'm out of here
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue.
What are you selling?
That's pretty low. Are you pulling my leg?
I'm talking about this house. This villa used to belong to President Shinra. It only recently came back on the market.
How do you like it?
It has a large lot, comes fully furnished with this goose-down bed, and there's even a basement to boot.
The villagers call it the Shinra Villa.
Of course, we're not giving it away…
How much is it?
Not interested
Wha? How do you plan to buy it without a dime on you?
Well, the price, for your information, is a steal at 300,000 gil.
Out of your range? Out! Go on, out!
All items in the basement are included in the sale.
Well, please come by again if you should strike it rich.
I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that to happen unless you win big at Gold Saucer.
Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa?
The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply… indescribable.
Well, let's wait for the captain.
Hmm Is this some kind of joke?
'Praise the Lord,' it's a miracle!! Who'd ever think someone with some real money would ever come here?
I probably shouldn't even ask, but are you really going to buy it?
Yep, 300,000 gil
I changed my mind
Hmm, good-bye!! Good-bye fluffy bed!!
Oh well, I'm kind of glad!
Bought "Villa CLOUD"!
This is MY villa. Rest up in your new villa?
With pleasure
Gotta move on
Cellar
…SNORE…SNORE…
Geez my lower back's killing me!
Y, yes…sir!!
How do you do? I'm the manager.
Nice to meet you.
Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night.
Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself.
Received "Motor Drive"!
Received "Fire Ring"!
Received "Power Source"!
Costa del Sol
Say, aren't you bored?
Not that much
Yeah, we fight a lot
Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
Oh, really? I'm a little bored.
Come on, back to work now!
Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.
What do you want to know?
Where's the inn?
Where're the stores?
Show me around town
Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.
If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.
Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook.
It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West, and is a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.
Come on! I don't care about that!
If you want a good time, go to the beach! There are lots of beautiful women.
You wouldn't happen to be…rich?
Oh yeah…
Well, not so
You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking.
But I'll tell you just in case.
After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!
I thought so.
Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.
Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.
But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.
But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.
Yo! Wassup! We jus' hangin' out!!
Oh, the sun's so bright! Looks like another wonderful day!
1, 2, 3, here we go!
I heard. That big dog talks like a human.
That's cool …but weird.
It's the ocean. A creepy man was signaling for us to come.
I was scared to come here!
Hm, that's interesting.
It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.
You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will.
Grrr…
Shall we play our hand around here?
Not yet. Remember, no compromises.
You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.
But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.
Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach.
I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.
Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.
How about some 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made especially in Costa del Sol!
Butch
Yeah, I'd like to find a gorgeous chick and have a great time.
Butch
Well, we're lucky to have that cutie working for us part-time.
Butch
You got me there… We just hired her part-time.
She ran off with our money and Materia.
I guess any situation that seems too good to be true, usually is.
Well, please feel free to browse around. Just don't mind looking at leftovers.
Ah, CLOUD! Let me make a buck why don't you?
I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some?
Orders are taken at the counter.
It hurts when you kick me with your bare feet!
Why's that!?
Not yet!!
Eaghhh!
It's your fault!
What's wrong with you!?
You wanna go!?
Whew!!!
Grrrrr…
A man…
A good-looking man…
Where?
Ho! Ho! Ho…
Yipes!!
Grrrr…
…pant…wheeze…
I don't feel like sightseeing around town. What I really want to do is have fun…  …too bad Gold Saucer is temporarily closed.
Butch
Good or bad everything's gotta go! It's the end of the world sale!!
Wanna buy a souvenir to remember participating in the Meteor tour?
Oh wow!! Man, that's huge!!
The stars!! They're in flames!!
They're burning. Someday they'll burn out.
The stars are just like our youth.
Ho! Ho! Ho! It's the end of the world.
Bar
You want drink? Iz OK. You take time.
Mukki
I really like this town.
You could walk around here naked, and no one'd look twice.
…huff…puff… I can't stand hot places…
…HIC… Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.
Hey! I thought you'd drop by.
(That's 1, 2…4 fishes all together…not bad.)
Come on…please. If you don't buy from me… I won't be able to pay the rent.
Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year.
I'm sick of surfing.
We're all headin' over to Gold Saucer now.
We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races.
Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.
Welcome to Bar del Sol! Here's to tropical nights!
We look like great surfers…
But the only clothes we have are these swim trunks.
I traveled around a long time… And this town has the most beautiful ocean I've ever seen.
Sometimes you can't recognize things when they're right in front of you.
I guess I took it for granted because it's so close, and I was so used to seeing it all the time.
That's why I came back here.
I don't care whether Meteor comes or not, I'm not giving up yet!
I still haven't surfed the best waves of Costa del Sol!
I hope the Meteor doesn't strike before I do.
It's weird seeing Meteor's reflection on the sea in the evening! It gives you the creeps.
But the sun has risen! ???
Well, for that reason, I'm at the store today too.
I wan' learn how speak beddah.
But don' wan' have stars fall down. You think…same?
Mukki
I just want to sit here with my drink.
My boss is a total arrogant ass!
I'm gonna tell him off! I'm gonna scream my head off!
Isn't that what life's all about? What do you think?
…huff…wheeze… Heat and cold are just memories of the Planet…
Come on…please. If you don't buy from me… I can't pay the rent. No one else will either.
While you're here, forget all those awful things going on outside, and just enjoy yourself.
Costa del Sol Inn
Uggh!  I feel God awful! Oh!! You!
Weren't you with that big sailor?
Dunno what you're talking about
Wasn't me
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Wrong guy? This is bad for us. That guy's taken over the john.
And he hasn't even paid his hotel bill yet.
Listen to this…
A big sailor just busted in here all of a sudden, and took over the restroom.
He's been in there moaning ever since.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Ah…if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?
Come now, we know he's a friend of yours…(fibber)
What now? Call it a night?
200 gil a night.
Stay
I changed my mind
What now? Call it a night?
200 gil a night.
Stay
I've changed my mind
Cradled by the sound of the ocean… sweet dreams…
Are you sure? Please come again.
Shucks!!  Too bad!
Hey! Hey you! Does your friend have a cute lady?
She came in here looking for him a while ago. You better find her.
What are you going to do? Just forget about her and go to bed?
200 gil a night.
Stay
Changed my mind
You look like you can handle it. Well then…
That's right. Don't worry. Please come by again.
Welcome!! What's it going to be?
200 gil a night.
Stay
Changed my mind
You sure? I'll just be playing around here so drop by whenever you feel like it.
You must be tired.
The weather for Costa del Sol tomorrow is going to be…sunny, again.
Good morning. Be careful traveling.
Your party has departed.
Oops…
That's bad luck…
I mean, they have already left.
Wait a minute! There's not enough money here.
Good morning!!
Uh uh!
Hmmm!?
Marlene! You OK?
I'll wear this when I go to see you.
Yo, CLOUD! Still too early, ain't it?
Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, alright!?
Whew… I don't know why I'm so tired.
There's so many things I don't understand…
I feel a little uneasy.
CLOUD…?
What do you think of me?
I dunno
Nothing much
I don't understand anything.
Sorry, but I never think about those things.
How could you say such a thing! Sometimes you make me so mad!
Oh, I never should have brought it up!!
…You're right.
Even I don't understand myself.
I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient?
What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it?
I don't understand it…
Ahh…I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this? Everything's so complicated.
I'm going to sleep.
I don't want to talk about it!
Be careful!
I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to spend the rest of my life sleeping.
Good night.
Will you be staying together?
Yes
No, thanks
Stop looking like a hunted animal! Whatever happens…happens.
Just go with it.
Johnny's New Home
Johnny
What's with YOU?
Johnny
Hey, is it really you?
We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were such a playboy.
And a $#&^ murderer!!
Why can't I remember your name?
Who are YOU?
I'm CLOUD, and don't forget it
Johnny
That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?
That's okay. We'll just pretend like we don't know each other.
I started a new life in this town.
A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my complaining! I sure envy you all living out under the stars.
Johnny
You think you're good enough to brag about how big you are?
I don't wanna hear it! Heh, no more complaining from me!
From now on, I'm turning over a new leaf!
Johnny
Go on and beat it!
I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life.
I'm sorry about that. He's had some big shocks and has been depressed lately.
Oh, right! I remember that, too.
Johnny
Yeah, yeah! And you remember the time when….
Hee, hee, hee!
Johnny
Ha, ha, ha!
Ha, ha…oh stop it! That's right. Oh really…
Johnny
Yeah. Oh yeah, and then that time…
Yeah, yeah!
CLOUD, would you mind leaving us alone for the day?
We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change.
Johnny
Yeah, don't get mad or anything.
I'll try not to be back too late.
So please don't worry about us!
Worry?
Yeah…
I'm not worried.
Just remember we're leaving early tomorrow.
You're right…
OK, I know.
Johnny
…mumble…mumble… (TIFA, promise me you're gonna be happy.)
Johnny
Heh, heh, heh! She and I are getting along pretty good.
But I'm such a pitiful waste…
Johnny
…sigh…I'm not good enough for her. What should I do?
Johnny
I proposed to her in the middle of all that Meteor stuff!
I don't care even if the world were to end right now!
I can't think of anything else!
Johnny
No, no, NO!! Meteor's getting closer every minute!!
I wanna live my life right now!! I want to build a home and grow old together with her!
If you can't do it, then I will! And that's that!
I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there too!
If you can't do it, then I will! And that's that!
I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there too!
Costa del Sol
Oh! CLOUD!!
Look, look at that!
Hm?
Who, Hojo?
That girl in the bikini?
Is that man over there, Hojo?
Go over and talk to him.
Not a bad view…
What're you looking at?
That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him!
God!! What do you want?
I want to talk with him
Is that Hojo?
(Hey, who do you think you are?)
Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you.
(What's his problem?)
Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!
Professor… someone's here to see you, sir.
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hojo
I'm busy right now.
…But, Too bad.
Hojo
No, I remember you all now…
Hojo
Heh heh heh… All right. You sure are loud.
Long time no see, CLOUD.
Hojo
Yes, yes. I remember now.
It's been a long time, CLOUD.
Hojo…
Hojo
Sometimes you just gotta do something like this.
What are you doing?
Hojo
It should be obvious, I'm getting a tan.
Answer me!
Hojo
Hmm! I believe we're both after the same goal.
You mean Sephiroth?
Hojo
Did you see him?
Hojo
I see…Ha! Ha!
What is it?
Hojo
Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis…
Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?
Or that you had to visit some place?
I'll go anywhere Sephiroth is at!
To beat him and put an end to all this!
Hojo
I see… This could be interesting.
Were you in SOLDIER? Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?
Hojo
Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?
CLOUD, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything!
Stop, CLOUD! I know how you feel, but you mustn't.
Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him.
…huff…puff… Stop, CLOUD!
Knock it off, CLOUD! Look I don't know, but he knows a lot of stuff, right?
Hojo
Ha! Ha! Ha!…
Hojo
Say, aren't you the 'Ancient'? 
I'm AERIS. The least you can do is remember my name.
I want you to tell me something, Professor Hojo…
I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me.
Hojo
Your mother? Oh, you mean Ifalna. How is she?
You didn't know!? She died.
Hojo
…I see.
Professor Hojo?
Is Jenova an Ancient? Is Sephiroth an Ancient? Do we all have the same blood?
Hojo
…
Hojo
…mumble…mumble…head west…
He's mumbling slowly… That must mean he's hiding something!
Hey! Answer us!!
Grrr, Grrr… …huff…puff…
It's no use. It's no go.
Professor Hojo is so sweet. He's going to experiment on me.
He never takes off his lab coat even in this heat. I guess that's the mark of an intellectual.
I'll interpret Professor Hojo's whispers.
Head west, past Mt. Corel and keep going…
Did you get that? I didn't understand it well, myself.
I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!
Yes, Professor Hojo. Where?
It looks like the Professor discovered or found a solution to something.
You know, I wonder… if they headed west for Mt. Corel?
I'm getting a little sad.
Professor Hojo looks happy like a child when he discovers something. He gets this big smile and then laughs…
I guess we should chase after him. A vacation for two from Mt. Corel to Gold Saucer.
That's right!! It totally skipped my mind!
There was something I was supposed to tell you.
That's right! It's about that!
It was yesterday. A man wearing a black cape came up from the ocean.
I think he had tickets for the Gold Saucer… no, that wasn't it… I wonder if it was all just an illusion?
Hey! President Rufus came here yesterday.
He used to be the President's little boy. We nicknamed him the little Prez!
He didn't look much different than the surfers on the beach.
heh heh… All the good ones are gone.
What about that one? Shall we make do with her?
But she's got a guy with her.
No problem, I can handle him.
Right? You thought so, too?
Geez! What about those two?
Heh heh…I want the one on the left.
Well then, I guess that leaves me with the one on the right.
Hey… heh heh…don't forget to talk to me, too.
Yipes!! Help!!
…breath…breath! Kind of takes your breath away, don't it!?
If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some "Soft".
At least that's what they always say, don't they?
Be prepared, and you'll never fear.
Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! Not bad, huh?
Hmm. Man, I'm draggin' today. It's all Shinra's fault.
I really hate Shinra, Inc.! They're all crooked, those Shinra.
Hmm… What a bitter guy Chill out a bit.
Eeeew!! Leave me alone!
Ublk! …glug…glug… You're gonna make me drown!
Always the same story… Women never pay any attention to me…
If this is your idea of flirting…forget it. I do fine as it is.
The sea, the wind and the sun. Don't you just love the outdoors? It always puts me back on track.
Hey, good timing. Would you mind putting lotion on me?
With pleasure
Sorry
Uhhhnn…
Than--kyu!
Hey, loosen up a bit.
Eaaggh!! Leave me alone!
I'm trying to learn how to swim before the end of the world.
Sitting around waiting for Meteor to come…… Why's it gotta fall on us?
It's getting closer and closer. Someone will do something, don't you think?
The sea breeze, sun and Meteor. Isn't nature strange?
I don't care even if it is the end of the world, I just want to sit here and drink cocktails!
Ooooh…I think I drank too much.
Mt. Corel
Whew!!
Hey!
You're actually talking to me.
I just passed a guy in a black cape back there.
I just tried to tell him that it's dangerous up ahead, and he ignored me!
What is it?
Sephiroth…
…ahh.
Let's hurry on.
There was a black-caped guy here, too?
Oh gawd, what a drag!!
Hmm… I'm moving on ahead…
It's dangerous up ahead. Be careful on your way.
If any strangers should greet you warmly while traveling, make sure to greet them back.
Whew! being on the road.

…something should happen.
Do it
Leave it
OK, then…
PHS
Let's move on!
OH!! CLOUD! That's it!
We can't go on until the bridge is let down.
I think there's a switch in that shack over there…
But there's too many monsters around and I'm beat…
CLOUD!!
I was just wishing you were here!
Unless someone lets down the bridge, we're stuck.
CLOUD should be able to do something.
But let's take a breather first.
Come on, CLOUD. Let's rest a minute.
Wha? Oh, it's you.
There seems to be an instrument in that hut that manipulates this bridge.
Perhaps it's best if we rest a moment.
…whew!
I don't want to have to go all that way!
I'm beat…
I'm sure glad I'm with you, CLOUD!
What?
I'm pooped!
CLOUD!! Go CLOUD!! Go!!

Times are tough… I'm taking the treasure.

Mt. Corel
Hey! How'd you ever wind up here?
Look, I'm sorry but, I can't do a thing for you!
Oh boy!! Corel sure has gone to pot. It used to be a famous coal mining town!
They say there were more jobs than you could shake a… Well, you get the picture!
Now, it's nothing but a miserable pit! Me, my bulldozer…everyone's out of work.
Got no job…I can't even show my face. Bout all that's left for me is just livin' in this hole all day.
Received "Mind Source"!
Received "Power Source"!

Mt. Corel
North Corel
You heard 'em… It's my fault this town was…destroyed…
Wait here…
Can't keep regrettin' the past… It's the future we gotta think about now.
…I'm sorry…
YOU know who's responsible for North Corel winding up like this!
Well, lookey here! Never thought I'd ever see your face again.
I'll never understand the rich. I heard some guy named Dio at the Gold Saucer is collectin' rocks!
I figure if I stay alive long enough, something good's bound to happen.
Some Shinra soldiers went up to Mt. Corel. They said they're collecting Huge Materia to blow up Meteor!
Ya think they can really do it? I'll bet the reactor destroys everything even before Meteor hits!
Look down… nuthin' but junk. Look up…Meteor.
Am I gonna be stuck between these two for the rest of my life?
“”
I wanna play at the Gold Saucer…
And it's only a Ropeway ride away… but I don't have enough money to play…
Those people over there, they with you?
Well, I feel sorry for 'em! Hangin' around a walkin' death sentence like BARRET.
They kick you out of another town or somethin'?
You destroy everything you touch.
Why doncha say something!?
Or did ya forget what you done here already?
Get out of the way!!
The only way we can make ends meet around here now is by collecting junk!
You, you're…
Hey!! He's back!
You got a lot of nerve comin' back here!
Look at this place! It's all your fault North Corel turned into a garbage heap!
^%$#! You ain't even worth the effort.
Don't waste your time talkin' to that Techno-freak!
Whenever I look up in the sky, I see Meteor staring me right in the face…
If you're gonna crash down, then hurry up!! Cause I'm gonna kick the $#@& outta ya!
A buncha guys called Turks came here sayin' they'd pay 10000 gil for some rock called a 'Keystone'.
When I asked how much they'd pay for a regular rock just layin' around here, they slapped me upside my damn head!!
Shinra soldiers came around sayin' they were gathering up all the Huge Materia.
I think they're gonna bring it here by coal train, from the Corel Reactor.
Staring up at Meteor won't put food in my stomach.
But if I look down, sometimes I find somethin' to eat.
I hear it's a big fad now in the city to get tattoos. Is that right?
I wouldn't know
That's right
Really…? I saw a big '1' on the arm of a young guy heading towards the Ropeway. That Black Cape he had on was really cool.
I guess I should get a '0' tattoo! For a poor man like me, 0' oughtta be perfect.
Hey, what's gonna happen to the world?
I guess no one wants to have fun anymore now that the Gold Saucer is closing…
Hey, the Gold Saucer reopened!
We've got to play hard to get our minds off Meteor.

Listen to your story
Not interested
Take that road on the left to the Ropeway station!
The Ropeway'll take you to the Gold Saucer.
It don't mean much to us poor folks though…
Sometimes, I see something glowin' inside the well. If I ever get it, I'm going to sell it and go to the Gold Saucer.
I'm gonna keep diggin' in this well till I come out on the other side of the world…
Then, I'm going to make lotsa friends.
I got this out of that well. This rock must REALLY be something!!
Whoops… You can't hold all those.
Here, I'll keep it in my pocket, and you can come by later and get it, OK?
I wonder what Shinra wants to do with all that Huge Materia?
What are we going to do now?
Sorry… I never shoulda gave that Huge Materia to the Shinra so easily…
No use baggin' on yourself! It's not like you, OLD guy!
It's not all over yet. Cheer up!
…Isn't is too early to give up?
Received "Ultima" Materia!
There's only one more Huge Materia the Shinra needs… That's the one at the Underwater Reactor.
With us always in their face, even the Shinra's gotta be getting tired of it all.
We have to hurry that much… …Right now I'm more worried about him than anything else!
Yeah, and I'm worried about TIFA, too.
Let's go see what's going on at Mideel…
We'll get there first!
CLOUD…
We HAVE to stop them!!
Must be about CLOUD…
We've got to hurry and stop 'em!!
You must be talking 'bout CLOUD…
We headin' out to the Underwater Reactor?
CLOUD…
Are we going to the Underwater Reactor?
CLOUD…
Inside Tent
Grandpa used to be a Coal Train engineer.
He still can't kick his old habits from then.
Seeing that train got Grandpa more excited than I've seen him for some time.
As long as we stay here, Grandpa won't be able to forget about trains.
Maybe we should start fresh, and move to Southern Isle of Mideel?
With Meteor coming, I guess it doesn't matter…
The next train's coming in soon.
What the? Watch out for the train!
Received "Ether"!
Inside Tent
Everyone knows that accident couldn't have been avoided.
But no one will be satisfied until someone takes the blame.
I hear something's gonna fall from the sky?
You saved my life. Not that I have much longer to live anyway…
I want to leave this garbage dump of a town behind me, and start a new life.
If I had a buggy, I'd cross the southern desert, and go to that town across the river…
There was something glowing in that well over there.
If I can get my hands on it, I'm gonna sell it and go to the Gold Saucer!
When I grow up, I'm gonna travel the world collecting glowing stones!
I got it out of the well. It must be a special rock!!
Hey? You can't hold anymore.
I'll keep it in my pocket for you. You can come by and pick it up later!
Received "Ultima" Materia!
Inside Ragged Hut
Because of them…ugh my husband got into that accident… He used to be such a strong man…
Is Meteor really going to crash down on us?
I'm still too young… I'll never remarry.
This memento is all I have left of my husband… I'll give it to you if you'll please stop Meteor…
How am I supposed to continue living in a town that lost everything?
To hell with the Mako reactor!
The town is in shambles… and Meteor is coming our way…
All we have left is our love for each other.
I don't want to die, but who can stop Meteor?
Yaaay!! What do you wanna play?
Hey, what's a Meteor?
Received "Catastrophe"!
North Corel Inn
Welcome. It's 50 gil a night. Would you like a room?
Yes
No
North Corel Inn
Hmm, you don't quite have enough.
North Corel Inn
Enjoy your stay.
North Corel Inn
Please come again.
You all right?
Some townspeople carried you here so the Shinra wouldn't find you.
How much more will they have to destroy before they're satisfied!?
Isn't anyone brave enough to stick it to Shinra?
Ropeway Station
Ride the Ropeway?
Go on
Don't go on
Ride the Ropeway?
Yes
No
What happened?
Shinra troops? What for!?
Let's get on.
That's so terrible!
Don't blame yourself. We were all fooled by the promises Shinra made back then.
I never knew. BARRET never said a thing…
…
We better go on!
Everyone's… been through a lot of hardship…
Sorry.
My hometown used to be around here.
It ain't here no more. Heard it got buried… in just 4 years.
An' it's my fault. ALL my fault.
There was an explosion at a reactor.
Shinra blamed the accident on the people. Said it was done by a rebel faction.
Well, I guess that's true. But more than Shinra, I can't forgive myself.
Never should've gone along with the building of the reactor…
That's why… that's why I get so pissed off!!
Not only did they take advantage of me… But I lost my wife, Myrna, too…
Dyne was my best friend. We were close ever since we were kids…
It's all my fault…
BARRET, what happened?
But how could those people say those terrible things?
…
Everything Shinra does seems to make everyone miserable…
What do you mean 'used to'?
…
I'm not sympathizing with BARRET! He never should have trusted Shinra, Inc.
I'm waiting inside.
The Ropeway takes you to the 'Gold Saucer'. It's free, so don't worry about it.
Hey everyone! If you want to go to the 'Gold Saucer', hurry and get on!
The Gold Saucer is currently closed. The Ropeway's up and runnin', but there's no point in goin' there.
The Gold Saucer reopened. Why don't you go play hard and clear your heads as well as your pockets?
I'm gonna use all my life savings before Meteor hits!
I know how you feel, but what if Meteor doesn't hit us? What are you gonna do then?
…My hometown, Corel's always
been a coal mining town.
It may be dusty and poor,
but it's calm…
It's a real small town.
That's the first time I ever heard
Mako Reactor mentioned since then…
We all dreamt of the good life.
Then, all of a sudden, Shinra troops came…
Village Headman
What are we going to do? The only one opposed to this is Dyne…
Dyne
I am definitely against it, no matter what. There's nothing to talk about if you're thinking of throwing away our coal!
Dyne
The coal's been ours for generations. Our fathers, and theirs before them, risked their lives for it.
We have no right to throw it all away so easily!
But listen, Dyne. No one uses coal nowadays. It's the sign of the times.
Scarlet
Right, everything is Mako, now.
It'll be all right, Dyne. Shinra, Inc. will guarantee your livelihood once the Mako Reactor is completed.
Listen, Dyne. I don't want my wife, Myrna, to suffer anymore.
Dyne
I know how you feel! I feel the same way too, damn it!
But even so, I won't give away our coal mines!
Village Headman
Dyne…you've got to understand.
That's how the Corel Reactor was built…and completed.
We all thought it would bring us an easier life.
It happened when Dyne and I were out of town for a few days.
Corel was burned down by the Shinra troops.
All the townspeople…
All my relatives……
Everyone…everything…

Here at the Gold Saucer, there are many places where you must pay with GP.
Just think of 'GP' as money that you can only use at the Gold Saucer.
GP can only be redeemed at the games in Wonder Square and at the Chocobo Races.
Your GP limit is 10000, so please be careful.
Would you like to change gil into GP? 1 GP is 100 gil.

I'm sorry, I'm gonna close this for awhile.
I'm just debating if I should be in business at a time like this.

I thought about it, but there was only one solution.
I believed that because of the way things are, there's a need for a place like this.

Welcome. This attraction is 3 GP.  
Shall you be riding this evening?
Yes, I shall
No, I shan't
Um, I'm very sorry, but you do not have enough GP.
Would this be your first time riding with us?
Yes, it would
No, it would not
You will be able to see all of Gold Saucer park on this ride. So please just sit back and enjoy a lovely view you won't see anywhere else.
Is that right?
This attraction can only accommodate 2 passengers, so one of you please wait over there.
Enjoy the sights of Gold Saucer.
Sorry but there's no show now.
We put on a really unusual show here. But not today, so come back again sometime and see it.
What's your problem? Can't you see we wanna be alone?
Geez, what a jerk. Why don't you just leave us alone?
Hey, I finally got 5000 points.
Hey, I got 5000 points again.

Man, I finally got a prize…
Well, I guess I'll go and get some more GP.
First, I gotta memorize the order it comes out, and then guess on the attacks… …mumble, mumble…
We have to be careful of these steps.
What? A lot of things…
Yaaay!!
Eyyaaaaaa!
Come on now, no running.
Now, now, be careful of Meteor.

How is it? You having fun?
Mmm, so, you ARE having fun. Well, good, good for you boy.
My name's CLOUD. And stop calling me boy.
Dio
Mmm? Me? I'm the owner of the Gold Saucer. The name's Dio.
Just call me 'Dio'.
(He's not even listening)
Dio
By the way, boy, do you know what a 'Black Materia' is?
Yeah, I know
What is it?
Dio
Ha ha ha…that, I say, that's a good one, boy! But it's not good to lie. You can't fool me.
Dio
Oh, so you do know?
Why d'you ask me?
Dio
Well, a while back, a boy your age came in and asked me if I had Black Materia.'
Dio
I thought you might know who he was, seein' as how you're both about the same age.
Did he happen to have…a black cape?
Dio
Why yes, yes indeed. And a tattoo on his hand that said '1'.
Where did he go!?
Dio
Ha ha ha, I have no idea.
Dio
Well then.
Dio
I say, stop by the Battle Arena if you like, boy.
You'll probably like it. Many of my collections are on display there.

This attraction is the Shooting Coaster.
While your ride's going ZOOM, you're going BANG BANG, and things are going PHEW PHEW and you destroy them with a big BOOM. Pretty simple, isn't it?
Oh, to shoot, hit [OK]. The bar on the left side of the screen is your Power Meter.
When it's full, it'll go BROOOOOM and when it's empty, it'll only go …brm…and putter out. So be careful.
If you make it to the Top 3, you'll get on the Wall of Fame.
It's currently under repair…

Whenever you come to the Gold Saucer, I recommend you visit the owner's museum at least once.
Crap! I still don't have enough points.
Hmm…
So, uh, how've things been since then?
No sweat
They're going
Hmm, pretty good.
Ha ha ha! Well, good luck.
Mmm? You're new here, aren't you? Then, you want an explanation of the Battle Arena?
Yeah
Not interested
What, you too? With the way things are in the world, It makes you wonder what we're doin' here?
Well, it's a little late for me to run around now, so I do what I love, it works best for me.
Oh, by the way, did you know? I heard that there's going to be a battle and only the strongest will be allowed to participate.
But what do they mean by 'strongest'? If ya ask me I'll say it's 'weapons.'
But, there's gotta be a way to measure this, too. Mmm, we need another way to measure strength.
You fight here and collect battle points. You can then exchange those points for prizes.
The Battle Game…even though it's a game you still use all your physical abilities. To participate, go to the front and pay yer GP's.
You can fight in up to eight battles. The more you win, the more battle points you get.
But, if you lose, you lose all your points So it's up to you whether or not to fight after each win.
They also make it harder by givin' out handicaps.
They decide what handicaps there'll be, and you won't know what you're up against until the battle.
Oh yeah, once you leave the Battle area, all your battle points will become useless. So watch it.
Oh, and one more thing. The maximum points you could get is 65000, no more. So if you get that many you should exchange them for something.
Sir, that entrance is for the challengers who have already registered. Please register here.
Um, I'm sorry, that's only for registered participants. You can't enter there until you register.
I'm sorry to announce that our prizes have changed. Your previous battle points are no longer valid.
Welcome. You currently have battle points.
Would you like to exchange them?
Yeah
No, thanks
Thank you very much. Please remember, your battle points become invalid once you leave the Battle Arena.
Man, I knew I should've stopped. But it's so hard to stop…
Maybe I could've made it a little further. It's so hard to know when to stop…
All right, it should be my turn comin' up here soon.
I'm not going to lose this time!
I'll give that Meteor my ultra kick… …or…maybe not.
Hey, have you heard? Something awful happened!
Two staff members and some Shinra soldiers were shot.
The soldiers died instantly, but the staff survived.
Those two over there eloped, saying something about Our last moments together---' I can't bear it.
I don't have anyone special in my life but when it happens, it happens.
…that's why I'm working now. Oh, sorry for going off like that…
Dyne…
You know, I've been thinking about it for a while now, but you must be pretty strong.
Probably strong enough to take on the top 1 or 2 fighters?
Maybe you'll be good enough for the big match…
How 'bout it? There's a private battle only for the strongest. Wanna try?

Welcome to Chocobo Racing.
I'm sorry, but this is for authorized personnel only.
Go---!! Do it----!! That's it----!!
I…I lost…
Yeahh! This is why I can't seem to quit.
You can only buy up to 3 tickets Think before you buy. For example, you could select half of the Chocobos and buy 3 boxes.
Boxes?
Not interested
A box is buying 3 combinations of 2 Chocobos.
For example, if you select Chocobo 1, 3, and 5, you can purchase combinations, such as 1 - 3, 1 - 5, 3 - 5.
You can also play the limited wheel by selecting a Chocobo.
Limited wheel?
Not interested
Playing a 'Limited wheel' means you select a Chocobo and use it in all of your combinations.
For example, if you have Chocobo 1, then you buy 1 - 2, 1 - 3, 1 - 4.
No matter how you make your bet, you win some and you lose some. It all comes down to skill and luck.
Hey, see that Chocobo on the odds sheet?
That's how you can find out about a Chocobo's condition.
Hmm… If you find out which are the strongest, then it's easy, right?
Well, not as easy as you think. It's not just a matter of the Chocobo's strength, but it also depends on the jockey and the Chocobo's personality.
If these are bad, the Chocobo may use too much stamina.
One usually buys tickets for the B and C rank races, right?
Rank?
Not interested
Oh, that's right.
In other words, the 'rank' is the Chocobo's 'strength'.  A is highest and C the lowest.
You can buy A rank tickets if you become a freelance Chocobo jockey.
Of course, the higher the rank, the better your item ticket. Hey, maybe I'll become a Chocobo jockey!?
How DO you become one?
Not interested
You can become one if you own a Chocobo …and have some connections. But Chocobo's are pretty hard to catch and I don't have any connections.
What?
What?
Sir, you can't do that!
Ticket Office
Welcome Please purchase your Chocobo tickets here.
If your ticket is a winner, you will receive an item ticket good for items on the panel.
Your item ticket may be exchanged for an item or GP at the exchange counter to the right of the entrance.
Welcome. Would you like to buy some Chocobo tickets?
Yeah
Explain it to me

Registration fees are 200 gil. Is that all right?

You can exchange your tickets for items or GP at the Exchange Counter to the right of the entrance.
You are allowed a maximum of 3 bets per Chocobo ticket.

Do you want to ride?

Hey, long time no see… How have you been?
Ester
There's a lot going on in the world outside.
It's little lonely around here, but you can't keep a jockey from doing what he loves.
Ester
How 'bout it, you want to ride again? You have your own Chocobo, right?
Ester
Yeahh, but jockeys can't buy tickets.
If you win, you'll get an item ticket, so try it!
Let me register
Tell me how to ride it
Don't do it
Ester
Hmm, it seems that no Chocobos can be registered…
Which one?
Ester
Congratulations! You're first!
Ester
And your Chocobo moved up a rank.
Ester
From the next race, that Chocobo will be in B rank.
Ester
From the next race, that Chocobo will be in A rank.
Ester
Wow! From the next race, that Chocobo will be in S rank.
Ester
Wow, that's great.
Looks like you don't have any rivals in the A rank anymore.
But you know, there's a rank that's full of those Chocobos.
Ahem!! From the next race, that Chocobo is…
S rank! Joe's usually in that group, too. So good luck.
Ester
Amazing…
This is the winningest jockey in S rank ever since Joe.
Good job. Here's a little something from me!
Received "Exp Plus" Materia!!

I'll register this C rank Chocobo.

Then I'll register this B rank Chocobo.

Then I'll register this A rank Chocobo.
Ester
Then I'll register this S rank Chocobo.

I changed my mind, don't do it
Ester
Which do you want, the long course or the short one?

Ester
Good Luck! Take care!
Hey, CLOUD. Let me ride once in a while.
Hey, CLOUD. Let me hop on sometime.
Sure
Nope
Ester
Oh, you forgot? It's all right. Ahem!
First use [ASSIST] to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.
This lets you control the Chocobo yourself or let it run on its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
Then, you're stuck…
But, most of the Chocobos I have are mellow and you should be able to handle them.
When you're riding, use [SWITCH] to Speed Up and [CANCEL]to Slow Down.
If you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it will quickly lose its stamina.
Use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use [OK] to get a boost of speed.
But this makes your stamina run out faster.
Some Chocobos are bad-tempered and can't pace themselves. They'll lose their stamina quickly.
Those Chocobos should be set on Manual to slow them down.
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,
Push [START] to end the race.

This is Mog's house. It's in Mog Forest on Mt. Mog.
The beginning of another day in the life of a Mog.
This year, Mog is pipapopupo years old. …that's 28 in human years.
He's at that age when he should be looking for a mate.
But before Mog can become an adult, he first needs to learn how to fly. 
Even though Mog trains hard everyday, he still can't seem to get off the ground.  
Looks like he's still got a long way to go…
Here's where you come in.
Help Mog learn how to fly by pushing [OK] and feeding him his favorite Kupo nut.
But don't overfeed him. He won't be able to fly if he's too fat.
[OK]…Give him a Kupo nut

It seems like Mog's decided to take another shot at it.
All right, Mog, fly! Your future happiness may depend on it.
Unfortunately, he didn't make it.
Poor Mog'll have to wait some time for a bride.
CONTINUE
PUSH [START]
Oh-oh, seems like you don't have enough Gil. Poor Mog, looks like he'll continue be lonely for a while.
Poor Mog, seems like he'll be alone for a while. 
He did it!  He's flying! Now, he's finally become a full-fledged Mog. 
Tired but relaxed, our little Mog turns out the lights early and goes to bed. Goodnight, and sweet dreams…
Oh? What's this? Here comes a female Mog! 
It seems like he likes her. 
Now, will Mog be able to fly gracefully in front of her?
Help him out with a few Kupo nuts. 
He's flying!! Mog was able to do it! She must have fallen for his graceful flying form.
Sometime later… Looks like things are going well with his new Mog-friend. 
Time for a quiet date in the forest.
Her name is Mag.
She is a good-natured Mog. 
Best of luck to the both of you, Mog and Mag.
May you have lots and lots of healthy Mogs! 
Uh…no worries there, I guess… 
~FIN~
Hey you!! What're you lookin' so down for!?
How 'bout it? Want me to read your fortune!? A bright future! A happy future!
Oh, but don't hold it against me if it doesn't come true!
Oh, so sorry! I'm a fortune telling machine. The name's…
You can only read the future?
You kidding? I can find missing things, missing people, anything!
Then can you tell me where a man named Sephiroth is?
Sephiroth, right!?
Okay, here goes!!
…Ordinary luck. It will be an active fortune.
Give into the good will of others, and something big'll happen after summer.  …Wait…hold on…
Huh? Let me try again.
Be careful of forgetfulness. Your lucky color is…blue?
…Forget it.
Wait, wait give me another chance!
What the?
What does it say?
What?
Read it out loud, CLOUD
What is it? Tell us!
What you pursue will be yours. But you will lose something dear.
I don't know if it's good or bad…
This's the first time I ever got something like THIS.
Then shall we?
Excuse me?
What are you talking about?
To where?
Huh?
Being a fortune teller, this is gonna bug me.
If I don't see how it turns out, I'll never be able to relax. So, I'm going with you!
Is it all right, CLOUD?
What are we going to do, CLOUD?
CLOUD, it's all right with you?
He's weird! CLOUD, don't let him come!
I'm comin' with you no matter WHAT you say!
H…hey!
Yaaay!!
Eaayyyyyyh!
Come now, no running!
Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have some fun!
Now, be careful of Meteor.
Let's get lotsa GP at Wonder Square and have a blast!
I'll hang in there, even if I'm alone!
Wonder Square
They probably told you at the entrance, but most of the attractions at Gold Saucer only take 'GP'.
They don't sell GP. You can only get 'em from the Wonder Square games or at the Chocobo Races.
Attention! Dismissed!!
Shinra soldiers… Even here…
What happened?
What?
What happened?
What is it?
Sh…!
I'm sorry, we're currently renovating. Please come again.
…
!!
Hmm!?
Dead…
What!?
What!? Why?
What the…
Wh…why?
Wa…wait CLOUD!
CLOUD!? Where are you going?
Hey, CLOUD!
Don't, don't just leave me!
Battle Square
I heard that this is the curator's favorite attraction. He even has his collection displayed in the arena.
Yeee-----ah!!
Ea…ggha…!
No running, you kids!
Be careful of the Meteor.
Are you here for the battle, too?
That's the idea
Not interested
Is that so.
I like fighters, but hate ones who're all talk.
I watched you win eight battles. I want you to have this!
Received "Sprint Shoes"!
Good luck in the future too!
Did Sephiroth do this!?
No…it's not him… They're all shot… Sephiroth would never use a gun…
Ugh, ugggh.
Hey, what happened!
Victim
Ugh…ugh…a man with a gun…on his arm…
It can't be!?
A gun on his arm!?
…did he!?
Wow, no way!!
Hold it right there! And stay quiet!!
Dio
Did you guys do this!?
N…no, it wasn't us!
Dio
I must've been wrong…
Dio
Stop them!!
Hurry and run, it's gonna get ugly.
He…hey!
Arena Lobby
Dio
That's as far as you go.
Wait, listen to…
CLOUD…
Arena
doing it.
Dio
One more to go.
Yes
Hey! Pay attention!!
Dio
I don't need to hear it. Pay for your crime below!!
Dio
Do it!
Corel Prison
Wo-ho! Welcome to Corel Prison.
Hold---it. If you wanna pass, you're gonna need the boss's permission.
…
You all right?
CLOUD, you all right?
Are you all right?
Hey, you okay?
Where are we?
A desert prison… Corel Prison…
A desert prison?
Yup, a natural prison in the middle of the desert… surrounded entirely by quicksand.
I heard that once you get in, you never get out…
But, there was one special exception…
Hey!! BARRET!!
BARRET!?
Mmm!? Isn't that BARRET?
Hey? Isn't that BARRET?
BARRET…
Did you…
Stay back! This's something I gotta deal with.
Jus' leave me alone…
Whew! That's one of your friends? He sure looks dangerous…
BARRET…
CLOUD, what should we do? BARRET's not his normal self.
…BARRET…
Hey, CLOUD! Just leave him alone.
I mean, he told us to, didn't he? Then that's that, right?
This one's been shot, too…
We should find BARRET before we go out into the desert.
Basement
Empty…
Corel Prison
You new? Then go and pay your respects to Mr. Coates.
Mr. Coates' Henchmen
More respects again? You sure are formal, go ahead…
I'll tell you one thing, rookie. This desert is extremely dangerous.
It'll welcome you in, but when you try to leave, it'll swallow ya.
I hear some of them never make it out… the best thing is to stay out of the desert entirely.
Ha ha ha
This elevator will take you to the top…
But, you gotta be picked as a Chocobo Racer, first.
Want to enter the Chocobo Race?
Not interested
Yeah, I want to enter
You thinkin' of livin' here forever? Then live a long life!
Then go get permission with the boss of this place.
Who's the boss?
You don't even know that? Oh man.
Empty…
This place is heaven.
Man with a gun on his arm?
Never heard of him.
You wanna see the Boss?
Go Southwest and you'll meet him.
You'll meet him.
Once out in the desert, stay still and don't walk.
Don't walk.
There's no way you'll ever see a mysterious Chocobo carriage. No way.
No way.
Those guys only tell lies. Only lies. Not one of 'em will tell you the truth. Just talk with 'em a couple of times, and you'll get sick of 'em.
Corel Prison
If you get lost in the desert, just keep going Northeast. If you're lucky, you'll make it back here.
Man, the Boss was REALLY in a bad mood today… Or was it one of his better days?
Prison Pub
A rookie? Then you gotta buy something. Yup, that's the rule here.
Container
Mr.Coates
Never seen your face 'round here before. Goin' up?
Not interested
Yeah, up
Mr.Coates
Heh heh! You sure got guts!
Mr.Coates
You don't seem to understand how things work down here. This is the Gold Saucer's garbage dump. And that makes alluv ya scrubs.
Mr.Coates
The only way to get back up there is to win the Chocobo Race.
Mr.Coates
But, it's not as easy as you rookies think.
Of course, if you got the boss's permission it'd be a different story, but YOU'll never get that!
Mr.Coates
Ha ha ha ha.
Mayor's Old House
BARRET!
Didn't I tell you not to come here!?
Ju…just hold on for a second! We just want to talk! You'll understand if you just hear us out!
BARRET!!
Didn't want none of ya to get involved…
Hey that's CLOUD's line! …It's too dangerous, I can't let you get involved…' blah, blah, blah…
Yeah. We're already involved in this.
We saw you and hurried here. BARRET, just tell us what's going on.
We saw you and hurried here. So come on BARRET, just tell us what's going on.
You guys…
I heard that the murders at the Battle Arena were done by a man with a gun-arm…was that you?
There's another… another man that got a gun grafted inta one of his arms. It was four years ago…
What the hell happened?
Dyne
What's done is done.
Dyne
Hey, BARRET! It's not over yet!
Everyone's waiting! Let's go back to the village!
I remember…
I was on my way home from visiting
a Mako Reactor being built.
BARRET! Dyne! Come quick! The village's being attacked! It's Shinra soldiers!
What!!!?
Dyne
C'mon, BARRET! We gotta hurry!
BARRET! Dyne! Protect the village!
Hmp!! Old man!!
Krggh!!
Dyne
BARRET!! You stay here!!
Shu' up!!
Dyne
Watch out!!
Scarlet
Kyaa, haa, ha!!
You can shoot all day and never hit them with aim like that.
Scarlet
Kya, ha, ha!!! Looks like one hit you!!
Scarlet
Kya, ha, ha!! Stop playing around and cover me!!
Dyne!! Hang on!!
Listen to me!! You're comin' back to the village, hear!!?
Dyne
Yeah… I ain't lettin' go…
You're comin' back… Everyone's waitin' for ya…
Eleanor… and Marlene… They all waitin' on us…
Dyyyyyyne!
From then on, I couldn't use my right arm no more.
…I was depressed for a while.
But then I threw away my artificial arm and got this gun grafted in.
Got a new right arm to get revenge on the Shinra, who took everything away…
Back then, I heard the doc say there was another man who got the same operation as me.
But, his was the left arm.
…
But…Dyne's injury was the same as yours, right?
Yeah, that's right. He was deceived by the Shinra too.
He'll probably join us to fight against the Shinra.
…Wouldn't bet on it. I gotta 'pologize to Dyne before I can rest in peace.
An' that's why I gotta go alone.
Do whatever you want… Is that what you want to hear?
Well, I can't let you do it. We need your help to save the Planet.
BARRET, this isn't the end.
Weren't you going to save the Planet?
@#$%! TIFA, you oughtta know by now.
…That's all right. I'm not so different from you.
That's easier to understand. It's you, BARRET.
So there it is, BARRET. So I guess it'll be BARRET, me, and…
I wonder if Dyne will join us?
Be careful.
Hmm? Shall I go with you?
Fortune's good. Everything is perfect!
You all sure are acting pretty heroic, considerin' we're not makin' any money on this…
Looks like we could get some sleep here.
Sleep
Don't sleep
Corel Desert
Wanna ride?
Get on
Don't get on
Corel Desert
Corel Prison
Dyne
…Dyne …is that you?
Dyne
Now that's a voice I haven't heard in years…
Dyne
A voice I'll never forget…
I always hoped I'd be able to see you again someday… I knew you were alive somewhere… we had the same operation.
Listen Dyne, I want to…
Dyne
I can hear her voice. What's that?
…?
Dyne
It's Eleanor's voice. Begging me… not to hate your rotten guts.
Dyne
That's why I never hunted you down…
…I know I was stupid. I'm not asking you to forgive me.
But…what're you doin' in a place like this?
Why ya wanna kill people who ain't even involved? Why?
Dyne
Why!? The hell do you care!?
Dyne
You think the dead understand why's? Is hearin' Shinra's excuses gonna make people in Corel understand anything?
Dyne
I don't CARE about reasons!
Dyne
All they give us is artillery and stupid excuses… What's left is a world of despair and emptiness…
…
Dyne
You still want to hear 'why'? …All right, I'll tell you.
Dyne
'Cause I want to destroy everything.
Dyne
The people in this city.
Dyne
This city itself.
Dyne
The whole world!
Dyne
I got nothing left in this world. Corel, Eleanor… Marlene…
Dyne, Marlene… Marlene's still alive.
Dyne
…?
I went back into town. I thought she was gone for sure.
I wandered around town for awhile…
That's when I found her… …found Marlene.
Dyne
…
She's in Midgar. Let's go see her together, all right?
Dyne
So…she's still alive?
Dyne
All right, BARRET. Then I guess you and me gotta fight.
What!?
Dyne
Eleanor's all by herself. I gotta take Marlene to her.
Dyne…are you crazy!?
Dyne
Marlene wants to see her mom, don't she?
Stop, Dyne! I can't die yet!
Dyne
Oh yeah? Well my life's been over ever since then.
Stop it! I don't wanna fight you!
BARRET!
CLOUD, you stay the hell out of it! This is MY problem!!
Dyne
…BARRET…
Dyne!!
Dyne
Back!!
Dyne
…I didn't just lose an arm back then…
I lost something irreplaceable. I don't know where it went wrong…
Dyne…I don't know either, man.
Is this the only way… we can resolve this?
Dyne
I told you… I… I wanna destroy everything…
Dyne
Everything… This crazy world… Even me…
An' what 'bout Marlene? What's gonna happen to her!?
Dyne
…Think about it…BARRET… How old was Marlene back then?
Dyne
Even if I did go see her… she wouldn't even know me…
Dyne
And what's more…BARRET…
Dyne
My hands are too stained to carry her anymore…
…
Dyne
BARRET…
Dyne
Give that pendant to Marlene… It was…Eleanor's… my wife's…a memento…
All right…
Dyne
…so…Marlene's… already…4…
Dyne…?
Dyne
BARRET… Don't…you… …Don't ever make her…cry…
Dyne!
Dy------ne!!
…Dyne. Me an' you were the same…
My hands ain't any cleaner… I shouldn't carry Marlene either…
Uuuurrrrrrgh!!!
Mr.Coates
You want somethin'?
I want to go up.
Mr.Coates
Like I told you before, you gotta get the boss's permission, then win the Chocobo…
Dyne's got his reasons an' can't speak.
So, I got this, instead.
Mr.Coates
Yeah, bull--!!
Mr.Coates
R, right.
Mr.Coates
Did you kill Dyne?
Mr.Coates
You must've. Or you'd never be holding that thing.
…So Dyne's dead… Maybe now, the place'll calm down a little.
Mr.Coates
Dyne didn't care who anyone was…
The hell do YOU know!!
Mr.Coates
R…ight! I mean, no, I DON'T know anything. S…sorry.
Then, will you get us outta here?
Mr.Coates
Huh? Oh man, you guys are mistaken.
Mr.Coates
I already told you, there's only one way to get outta here.
Mr.Coates
That's to win the Chocobo Race and that's held up there, in the Gold Saucer.
Mr.Coates
And, only one racer can go up at a time.
Say what!?
Mr.Coates
Noooo! Really, even if you threaten me!!
A rule's a rule. I can't change it.
If I do, the whole system down here'll get messed up!! An' I can't do that!
Mr.Coates
OK, OK, I'll let one go up there. After that, he's gotta deal with Dio.
Alright then.
CLOUD, you go.
We'll wait down here.
Hurry up an' win that Chocobo Race, an' get us outta here!
You're right. CLOUD should do it.
Yes, good luck, CLOUD.
Right, CLOUD. We'll be waiting and rooting for you.
Well, CLOUD go get 'em!
OK CLOUD, knock 'em dead!
Mr.Coates
Have you decided?
Mr.Coates
All you need now is a manager…
To register and get a Chocobo…
Hi. I happened to hear your story.
Mr.Coates
Ester?
Ester
I'll be your manager.
Mr.Coates
Well, I have nothing against it, but…
Mr.Coates
This is Ester. She may look kinda funny…
But there's no better manager in the races…
Ester
That's so rude…
Ester
Yeah, well. Nice to meet you, CLOUD.
Mr.Coates
All right then, CLOUD.
I'll send you up the elevator. Ester'll fill you in on the details.
Ester
Hmm, so that's what happened. I'll talk to Dio directly. 
You just concentrate on the race.
Oh yeah, getting back to the other thing, there are many different types of Chocobo jockeys. It's not only for criminals.
Some people compete for the fame, some people compete for the money, some only for glory… And then there're people like you.
Oh yeah, I'll teach you how to ride a Chocobo.
All right
Not interested
Ester
Ummm… First use [ASSIST] to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.
This lets you control the Chocobo yourself or lets it run on its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
Then, you're stuck…
But, most of the Chocobos I have are mellow and you should be able to handle them.
When you're riding, use [SWITCH] to Speed Up and [CANCEL] to Slow Down.
But, if you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it will quickly lose its stamina.
Use the Directional button to move the Chocobo left and right, use [OK] to get a boost of speed.
But this makes your stamina run out faster.
Some Chocobos are bad-tempered and can't pace themselves. They'll lose their stamina quickly.
Those Chocobos should be set on Manual to slow them down.
Finally, some advice for the restless. Once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,
push [START] to end the race.
Waiting Room
Man
You new?
Ester
Hi, Joe.
Joe
Hey, Ester you're looking pretty as usual.
Ester
Thanks.
Ester
Let me introduce you, CLOUD.
This is Joe, one of the top Chocobo Jockeys.
Joe
Nice to meet you, CLOUD.
Joe
If you're with Ester, then…
Ester
Right! He's an up and coming jockey.
He'd only been down there a day and already he made it up here!!
What!?
Joe
Oh, I see…
Joe
So why did you get put down?
Sorry…we're not supposed to ask about the past here.
Joe
Hmm.
Joe
Pretty interesting… I have a feeling that we'll meet again.
Joe
Then, until we meet again, CLOUD.
Ester
I'm going to check on the Chocobo. You just wait here for a while.
Ester
I'll be right back.
……
I got nothing to say.
Don't get cocky. Skills don't matter once you get in the race…
The race will start in a few moments. Will the jockeys for the next race please proceed to the paddock.
I repeat…
Ester
CLOUD.
Ester
Thanks for waiting. I registered you in the next race.
Ester
This is a Chocobo I prepared myself. He should do well.
Ester
So… Remember how to ride?
Uh, how was it again?
Yeah, I got it
Ester
Then, good luck.
Ester
Let's see First use [ASSIST] to choose either AUTO or MANUAL.
This lets you control the Chocobo yourself or let it run on its own.
But it's pretty hard to make the Chocobo run the way you want it to. If the Chocobo doesn't like you, it won't listen.
Then, you're stuck…
But, most of the Chocobos I have are mellow and you should be able to handle them.
Ester
When you're riding, use [SWITCH] to Speed Up and [CANCEL] to Slow Down.
Ester
If you go faster than the Chocobo can handle, it'll quickly lose its stamina.

Use the Directional buttons to move the Chocobo left and right. Use [OK] to get a boost of speed.
But this makes your stamina run out faster.
Ester
Some Chocobos are bad-tempered and can't pace themselves. They'll lose their stamina quickly.
Those Chocobos should be set on Manual to slow them down.
Finally, some advice for the restless, once the first and second Chocobo cross the goal line,
Push [START] to end the race.
Ester
Too bad.
Ester
You were so close.
Ester
I expected more from you.
Ester
That was a tough break.
Ester
Let me find a better Chocobo for you.  Wait here for a while, OK?
Ester
If you couldn't win with that last Chocobo…
Ester
All right, I'll go get the best Chocobo there is!
Ester
You gotta be kidding me!? There aren't any other Chocobos better than the last one!
Ester
Well, if you really want to win, just push [ASSIST] and try the 'AUTO' mode.
Ester
Congratulations!! Now you're home free!
Ester
Oh yeah, the owner told me to give this letter to you if you won.
Dio
Boy, if you're reading this letter, then you must've won. I know you earned it.
I heard about Dyne from Ester. Now that you won, I'm granting you and your friends a full pardon, and setting you all free.
And by way of apology, I have a little gift for you to use on your journey.
Sorry I couldn't be there to tell you this in person, but I'm a very busy man. Sincerely, Dio
A gift?
CLOUD, this is great!! The assistant manager just stopped by and dropped off a 'buggy'!
Now we can go over deserts' and 'rivers', no problem.
OK, CLOUD. I'll be waiting outside.
(Hmm? The letter continues…)
P.S. I recently met Sephiroth. I'll bet he's pretty popular with boys your age.
Why don't you get his autograph? He was heading toward Gongaga, south of the river.
Sephiroth…
Ester
I guess this is goodbye.
Yeah. Well, if you ever get your own Chocobo, come back again.
I'll take care of your registration and everything. I'll see you again.

You a traveller? Hey wait, that glow in your eye… Are you in SOLDIER?
Grandma
Oh, you're right! Don't you know anything about our son?
Grandpa
His name is Zack.
Grandma
It's been close to 10 years since he left for the city, saying that he didn't want to live in the country…
Grandpa
He left saying he's going to join SOLDIER. You ever hear of a Zack in SOLDIER?
Hmmm…I don't know.
Zack…
Grandpa
Young lady, you know him?
Grandma
I remember he wrote us 6 or 7 years ago saying that he had a girlfriend. Could that have been you?
…No, it wasn't.
Zack…
Grandpa
Do you know him, young lady?
What a shock… I didn't know Zack was from this town.
You know him?
Didn't I tell you? He was my first love.
…
Zack… SOLDIER First Class. Same as CLOUD.
Strange, there aren't that many who make First Class, but I've never heard of him.
That's all right. It's all in the past now. I was just worried because I heard he's been missing.
Missing?
I think it was five years ago. He went out on a job, and never came back.
He loved women, a real lady's man. He probably found someone else…
Hey? What's wrong?
Poor guy
(…jealous…envious…)
I don't really mind that I haven't heard from him. But I feel for his parents.
Are you…jealous? Hmm?  Hmmm? Are you, CLOUD?
I'm kidding. I'm sorry.
I was hoping maybe you were…
AERIS…
Let's go, CLOUD.
Zack…
Do you know him?
N, no, I don't know him!
Your face tells me differently.
I told you, I don't!
All right.
…
That sounds just like you, leaving town, and saying I'm joining SOLDIER!'.
There were a lot of guys like that back then.
You must really be something making it in SOLDIER out of a group like that.
I really respect you…
I just got lucky
I worked hard for it
Don't be so humble!
Hard work pays off, huh.
You know…
I'm as proud of CLOUD joining SOLDIER as if it were me.
CLOUD, thanks for caring.
A reactor explosion three years ago took my husband…
Do people really need reactors to live?
Aren't there more important things in life?
You want something?
Buy weapons?
Hear a story?
Nothing in particular
Huh, did you want something?
Buy accessories?
Hear a story?
Nothing in particular
Uh, need somethin'?
Need a room?
Hear a story?
Nothing in particular
Oh, you here to shop?
Buy items?
Hear a story?
Nothing in particular
Mayor
This is Gongaga Village. Many people died here in a Mako reactor explosion.
Mayor
The Shinra people told us that everyone would be happy once the reactor was built. But all it brought us was sadness…
…
Shinra built the reactor, without even thinking about the town's safety. And, this is the result.
One day, a huge explosion. killed many of the townspeople…
It's been a while since the explosion, but you can still find the pieces it left all over town.
We voted to outlaw the use of Mako energy and live with nature, ever since the explosion.
People can live without the Shinra's Mako Reactors.
No matter how much I pray, it won't bring our grandson back…
…You don't have enough money. Come back when you get some.
It's 80 Gil a night.
Pay up
Don't pay
There's something shiny back there…
Don't do anything
Reach for it
A ruined reactor.
AERIS…
TIFA… What happened?
What happened to you two?
…Zack.
Zack. I don't know anything about that man.
…But That name sounds familiar…
Why?
That can't…
Grandpa
Have you ever met someone in SOLDIER named Zack?
Grandma
I can't believe he hasn't contacted us in 10 years…! …After all, we're his parents.
It's 300 Gil a night.
Pay 300 Gil
Don't pay
I am a traveling salesman, going around the world.
I came because I heard that near this village was Materia strong enough to shake the earth.
Even I get homesick and want to see my family.
I have a favor to ask of you. Can you get this letter to my lovely wife?
Will you do it for me?
Take the letter
Not interested
My wife lives in Kalm. I really appreciate this.
What's going on in a world about to end? Is kindness the first to vanish?
They sell the weapons on the second floor. Climb up the pole to get there.
Lifestream? Never heard of it.
Planet structure? …Who cares about that?
Why don't you go ask Bugenhagen of Cosmo Canyon hard questions like that?
Seems like the Shinra is planning something big to destroy Meteor…
I heard they're going to do something with all that Huge Materia they've been gathering…
After what happened with the reactor you can't trust Shinra.
…Everyone's going to die. Everything's coming to an end.
You lost? When that happens the only ones you can count on are your friends.
The first thing you gotta do is find your best friend.
This reactor's useless, but I hear there's still Huge Materia at the Corel, Fort Condor, and the Junon reactors.
Shinra's gathering all the Materia from those places… But for what?
Shinra's tried a lot of things, but it's only HUMAN. It's fate that Meteor will kill the people.
Tell me, young man.
Can't we be happy without having to sacrifice anything?
Can't time pass without unhappiness?
Hey, CLOUD. How did the Turks know to wait and ambush us here?
…You'd think someone told the Shinra about us?
…Is someone there?
Reno
Hey, Rude. Who do you like?
Reno
What are you getting so embarrassed about? Come on? Who do you like?
Rude
…TIFA.
Reno
Hmm…
Reno
That's a tough one.
Reno
But, poor Elena. She…you…
Rude
No, she likes Tseng.
Reno
I never knew that! But Tseng likes that Ancient…
What are they talking about?
Elena
It's so stupid!
They always talk about who they like or don't like. But Tseng is different.
Elena
Ah! Oh no!
Elena
They're here! They're really here!
Reno
Hmm… Then it's time…
Reno
Rude…don't go easy on them even the girls.
Rude
…Don't worry, I'll do my job.
Elena
Then, we're counting on you. I'll report to Tseng!
Reno
It's been a while.
Reno
Payback time for what you did in Sector 7.
Sector 7?
Out of our way
Reno
That's sad.
Reno
I don't like being taken for a fool.
Hey, something seems wrong, Like they knew we were coming.
…How could they know we were coming here.
I don't like it. How'd they find out where we were?
Interesting… They were definitely waiting for us.
I don't like this! It's like the whole world knows where we're going.
How'd they know that we were here?
How did they know that we were here?
They followed us… But there weren't any signs of it. Then, that means…
A spy? No way.
That there's a Shinra spy…
A spy, maybe? No, no way.
…someone's been informing them.
Maybe it's someone in this group?
You don't think there's a spy, do you CLOUD?
I hate this. Now everyone's gonna blame me because I'm new.
It means there's a Shinra spy…
I don't even want to think about there being a spy…
I trust everyone.
Rude
That's as far as you go.
Man, looks like they've taken a short cut.
And a couple of Shinra dogs are here too!
The Shinra build reactors to make money. And this is what happens.
You saw that village. It's always the powerless that suffer from tyrants like Shinra.
The one's with the power control those without it. That's just the way of the world now.
But I can't let 'em do that. That's why I formed AVALANCHE to fight 'em.
…Yo, CLOUD You still gonna fight with us, right?
We need you, man.
You got it
Not interested
Thanks, man.
…!!
I never shoulda believed you.
Scarlet
This reactor's a failure.
What I'm looking for is big, large, Huge Materia. You seen any?
Tseng
…No I haven't seen it. I'll get on it right away.
Scarlet
Please. We could make the ultimate weapon if we only had some.
Tseng
I just can't wait.
Scarlet
With Hojo gone, the Weapon Development's been getting a bigger budget.
Tseng
I envy them.
Scarlet
But, even if we make the perfect weapon, could that stupid Heidegger even use it?
Tseng
…
Scarlet
Oh…sorry! I forgot Heidegger was your boss! Ha ha ha!
Scarlet
Let's go!
…Big, large, Huge Materia?
An ultimate weapon? The perfect weapon?
Just what are the Shinra up to?
It's Scarlet, Head of Shinra Weapon Development.
Scarlet
Hmph! This isn't any good either.
You only get junky Materia from junky reactors.
Reno
This is just part of the job. Don't take it personally.
Cosmo Canyon
Cosmo Canyon
I am home! It is I, Nanaki!
Hey, Nanaki! You're safe!
Come on, and say hello to Bugenhagen!
…Nanaki?
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Are you familiar with this land?
Yes
No
Welcome to Cosmo Canyon. Make yourselves at home.
You lied. That is something that is not treated lightly here in Cosmo Canyon.
Let me explain.
People from all over the world gather here to seek the Study of Planet Life.
Wooooooooo!
I always wanted to come here!
Ummgah! I'm sorry it's full now, so I can't let you enter.
They helped me when I was on the road. Please let them in.
…Oh, is that so? You helped our Nanaki? Please, come in.
Who is Nanaki?
Nanaki is Nanaki. That's his name.
Leaving already? You should get some rest.
Since you're here, why don't you listen to Bugenhagen's story?
Leaving already? But it appears your friends still want to learn more about the Planet…
Did you get to see Bugenhagen's contraption? If you haven't yet, you must!
Hm? If you're looking for Bugenhagen, he went to the Sealed Door.
Remember, there's a steel door on the way to Bugenhagen's room.
What's that door there for anyhow? It's been closed forever…
Oh, it's you. This is terrible. The color of that unlucky star…
The children are all so scared that they won't even go outside.
I'd rather not see it either…
Bugenhagen seems rather down ever since he returned from that trip.
I'm worried something might happen to Bugenhagen now of all times…
Nanaki, it's really bad. Ever since Bugenhagen returned from that last trip, he doesn't seem well.
Why don't you hurry and see Bugenhagen?
Bugenhagen is what keeps our hearts strong…
Here is where I was…I mean, …this is my hometown.
My tribe were protectors of those who appreciate this beautiful canyon and the Planet.
My brave mother fought and died here, but my cowardly father left her… I am the last of my race.
Cowardly father?
Yes. My father was a wastrel.
And so the mission I inherited from my ancestors is to protect this place. My journey ends here.
Hey! Nanaki--! You're home!
Coming, Grandpa!
Good timin'. Let's take a breather.
I got stuff I want to find out, too.
That's perfect. Why don't we take a break too? We can meet back here in a while, OK?
Let's rest for a bit. There are some things I want to find out about anyway.
Rest, rest, rest! I wanna rest! Ok! That's that!
I'm just dead tired. Everyone, how 'bout some rest?
Yaaay! Nanaki! Nanaki's back! It's all thanks to this flame!
This fire is called 'Cosmo Candle'. It has burned for generations.
It is a holy flame that protects this canyon.
I've heard it only went out once, long ago.
The elders said something horrifying occurred, but I really don't know much else about it.
So this is Cosmo Canyon… Quite a mysterious place.
Have you come to seek the Study of Planet Life?
That's it
No
Oh yeah? What? The car broke down!?
Why don't you look around Cosmo Canyon while I fix the car?
Please get some rest while I fix your car.
The repair on your car is completed.
Now you should be able to go wherever you want.
How much do I owe?
Much obliged
No charge! You'd do the same for me, right?
Please, take 1000 gil
I guess you're right
…You don't even have that much. Don't tease me, okay?
Are you sure…? Well, all right. Thank you.
Oh yeah. Did you stay at the inn already?
There was a bottle on the sofa there a couple of days ago…was it yours?
Oh, really?
There really isn't much else to see here.
Yeah? I heard there's an awesome observatory here. I'd like to see it if I have a chance.
Whoa!!
Don't scare me like that. I almost fell over.
Nanaki, are you leaving again? We want you to stay here forever…
Mmm… I think the teachings of the 'Study of Planet Life' are true.
But can people used to Mako energy ever go back…?
Mmm… I can't stand here talking about the Study of Planet Life'.
I think I'll head back to my homeland now…
Oh, Nanaki's with you. Make yourselves at home.
Wait for me! I'm coming too!
Mmm?
Bugenhagen
CLOUD. Please look after Nanaki.
What happened?
I think I grew up a little. That's what happened!
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. Come back whenever you need my knowledge.
Tasty Cocktails!
Pub "Starlet"
Fluffy Beds!
In "Shildra Inn"
Come in today!
It's right near Cosmo Candle!
Cosmo…Canyon? I wonder if there's any relation to the planet or the Ancients…
I finally made it… So this is…Cosmo Canyon!
RED XIII seems different, doesn't he?
Hmmm… Any Materia? Any Materia around?
Hmmm…So this is Cosmo Canyon.
Cosmo Canyon
Oh, welcome.
The people of this canyon hate to compete. So almost everything here are replicas.
But that's all right. Some of them you really can use.
Welcome. You still want more weapons? You sure are weird…
Uh, I mean, it's weird. If there weren't people like you, I'd be out of business. Heh, heh, heh…sweat…!

Elder's Room
Elder Hargo
Where did I put it? I know it's around here…
Elder Hargo
Mmm? Oh, we have guests.  Good, good.
Elder Hargo
I know, I know.
You came to ask me something, right? Am I right?
It's about the Promised Land
Not really
Elder Hargo
…The Promised Land. So what do you want to know?
There is no one place called the Promised Land. That's what I believe.
No, no, it does exist. Hmmm…you can say that.
In other words, it doesn't exist for us, but it did for the Ancients.
The Promised Land is the resting place of the Ancients.
The life of the Ancients is one continuous journey. A journey to grow trees and plants, raise animals, and make Mako energy.
Their harsh journey continued throughout their lives…
The place they returned to after their long journey… Their burial land is the Promised Land.
Huh? Supreme Happiness? I believe that, for the Ancients, it was the moment that they were able to return to their Planet, That moment when they were released from their fate, and gained their supreme happiness…
At least that's what I believe. I really don't know whether or not it's true.
Elder Hargo
Oh, that's not what you're here for?
I'd appreciate it if you didn't talk about such foolish things as legends and old wives tales.
There was this guy who studied Planetary Life' here.
He couldn't take things the way they were, so he went to Midgar to form AVALANCHE.
Wanna hear more?
Go on
Not really
Guess you could say this is where AVALANCHE was born.
I always wanted to come here… And finally…I made it.
A lot's happened…
And then?
Yeah, whatever…
And then…? I don't know what's going to happen, now that there is no AVALANCHE…
What?
By the way, those that came with you are all at the Cosmo Candle.
Are you leaving?
Elder Hargo
Ahh, here it is.
My job is to gather all the legends and the knowledge of the Planet and to make a book.
Then, even when I return to the Planet, the children may still be taught about many things…
Elder Hargo
Mm…oh, this? This is the Book of Stars. I'm just finishing it.
Nothing is meaningless. If I do this then, someday, someone will run across it.
The Ancients did the same. That is how we know about them, right? Maybe even my book also…
Elder Hargo
I think Bugenhagen has foreseen things.
About the Planet… About Nanaki… And, about himself…
But, Bugenhagen would never say that. All he says is 'Ho Ho Hoooo'…
Pub "Starlet"
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'.
It'll be 100 gil a night. Would you like to stay?
Yes
No thanks
Welcome to 'Shindra Inn'. It's times like this when a nice soft bed will do you good.
It's 100 Gil a night. Would you like to stay?
Please
No thank you
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'
As long as there are guests, our lights will always be on.
It will be 100 Gil a night, Like a room?
Yeah
No, thanks
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'
It's times like this when a nice soft bed will do you good.
It will be 100 Gil a night. Would you like a room?
Yes
No, thanks
Welcome to 'Shildra Inn'
As long as there are guests, our lights will always be on.
It is 100 Gil a night. Would you like to stay?
Yes
No thanks
I'm sorry, but you don't seem to have enough for a room…
Have a great dream of the stars…
Well then, please come again.
Were you able to hear the stars whispers?
Welcome. How 'bout our original cocktail, 'Cosmo Candle?'
A drink now and then is good for you. It'll relax you a bit. …If you know when to stop.
How about our original cocktail, 'Lifestream'?
You should forget your troubles with a drink. We humans sure are weak creatures…
That reminds me. I heard that someone here in Cosmo Canyon is selling some Healing Materia.
Elder Bughe
Mmm…
Elder Bughe
What is it?
The story of the Ancients
Nothing
Elder Bughe
…Hmm. That's no fun… I wanna tell a story.
Elder Bughe
You can't talk of the Ancients, without mentioning Professor Gast. He used to come here sometimes.
He was a Shinra scholar who spent his life studying the Ancients.
He was a serious person, you never would have thought he'd be in Shinra.
Must've been about 30 years ago, when he found the corpse of an Ancient. He was elated!
If I recall…he named it 'Jenova' and was doing a lot of research…
One day, he showed up here, looking very distressed.
He was mumbling something about Jenova not being an Ancient and that he'd done a terrible thing…
He's been missing since then. I heard that he never went back to Shinra
So, if you ever see Professor Gast, I want you to tell him…
That the old man that likes to drink in Cosmo Canyon, wants to hear about the Ancients.
Well, there's lots to talk about, but most things about the Ancients are all legend and folk tales, and no one knows the truth.
Elder Bughe
Mmm. I'm starting to feel good now. That bartender's cocktails always hit the spot.
Elder Bughe
Is that so? You brought Nanaki back here?
Yeah, thanks.
Elder Bughe
By the way, your friends are all in front of the 'Cosmo Candle'
Are you all leaving now?
Maybe there are some people here that know about the Promised Land and the Ancients.
RED XIII… I wonder what's happened to RED XIII…? He's as excited as a little boy.
Are you going somewhere?
Hmm?
Elder Bughe
Live with the Planet, die with the Planet.
Maybe this is the way it should be. Who knows? I'm full of booze…
It's when I think about the children. I wonder if we can just save our own children.
Elder Bughe
Where is the Promised Land…? Maybe Bugenhagen knows.
Isn't Nanaki starting to notice? The reason why Bugenhagen sent him away from the canyon…
[Turtle's Paradise]
No. 5
Our cocktails are good but our wine is the best! Please stop in the Turtle's Paradise!!
Materia Shop
…num…yawn…Sir… You…forgot…your… …change.
…num…Yes, I'm coming…
Are you here to shop?
That's right
No, what's your problem?
Oh…is that so… then let me…yawn…sleep…
Oh…is that so…  You're here to shop?
I'm sorry! We hardly ever get any customers. Oh, but I DO have confidence in our Materia!
I'm…I'm so sorry! It seems I've gotten used to being lazy…
Oh man… Everything will be over, once Meteor hits…
I've been selling Materia for 10 years now, ever since I was 16. Geez, what have I been doing with my life?
Welcome! Oh, it's nothing. Now, please make yourselves comfortable!
Thank you very much!
Oh man! This place looks like a real drag. And their Materia sucks, too.
God. I HATE studying!
Cosmo Canyon
Oh, welcome home. You want dinner first? Or…
Dinner
Or…
All right, it'll be ready in no time…
Oh honey…
Wh…who are you? You…can't just come barging into my home uninvited!!
Hmm, this place seems like it has a lot of secrets.
So, when's dinner?
All right, all right. I'm making it right now.
…But I wonder which one is going to eat…
Those two…uh, Anyway, are you two friends? It really seems strange.
What did they say?
Oh man, I'm so busy. I need more help. …mummble…complain…
Hmm… I wonder what's going to happen now?
Don't worry, Mom! All of us just need to go through that door!
Mr. Bugenhagen sealed it so we wouldn't have to worry about it!
But what's a seal?
What's wrong with Bugenhagen? Is he sick?
No need to be sad, even if something should happen. Everything will return to the Planet…Bugenhagen says so.
Just the thought of something happening to Bugenhagen…worries me.
Nanaki's Room
Don't worry about me. I've seen it many times.
I haven't been back for a while… Let me rest for a bit.
It's not that I'm afraid of that big star.
It's just that, uh, I have a stomach ache… That's why I'm not moving. That's the truth!
Both Nanaki and Bugenhagen are gone… I feel so lonely…
That Nanaki's slick! He said, I'll protect this canyon'! But he didn't. Forget about Nanaki.
Sorry…I'm really sorry. But now, I have…
He's finally come home, but Bugenhagen doesn't seem well…
I want to hear Bugenhagen talk with Nanaki like we used to do…
Nanaki, is it true that Bugenhagen left on a journey? Then that means he's better, right? He IS going to come back soon, right?
…
…Don't worry. Grandpa will come back floating, saying 'Ho Ho Hoooo' again…
Yea, that's right! Ho Ho Hoooo'!
It's Ho Ho Hoooo! Ho Ho Hoooo!
Shildra Inn
Received "Elixir"!
Item Store
Hello. Looking for anything in particular?
Hi. Of course, our store's open.
No need to fear. I have the Study of Planet Life' right here.
No, maybe I AM a bit afraid. But, whenever I'm reading 'Study of Planet Life,' I can forget all my fears.
Received "Elixir"!
Received "Telpostone"!
Received "Magic Source"!
Received "Full Cure" Materia!
You can not take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Gate of Naught
Bugenhagen sealed this door shut.
How'd he do that? With super glue?
Nope… It doesn't open… How'd he seal it? With a huge magnet?
It seems like the only one that
can open it is Bugenhagen…
Observatory
Bugen Research Center
CLOUD, this is my grandfather, Bugen.
He is incredible. He knows everything.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. I hear that you looked after Nanaki. 
Bugenhagen
Nanaki is still a child you see.
Please stop, Grandfather. I'm 48.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. Nanaki's tribe has incredible longevity.
So you see his 48 years would only be equivalent to say that of a 15 or 16 year old in human reckoning.
15 or 16!?
Bugenhagen
He's quiet and very deep. You thought he was an adult?
…Grandfather. I want to be an adult.
I want to grow up to be able to protect you and the village.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. No Nanaki. You can't stand on your own yet.
Bugenhagen
To do that now would destroy you in the long run.
Bugenhagen
Reaching up into the heavens, threatening to snatch the very stars from the great city of Midgar. You've seen it, haven't you?
Bugenhagen
Well, that's a bad example. Looking up too much makes you lose perspective.
Bugenhagen
When it's time for the Planet to die, you'll understand that you know absolutely nothing.
…When the Planet dies?
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. It may be tomorrow, or 100 years from now… But it's not long off.
How do you know this?
Bugenhagen
I hear the cries of the Planet.
What's that?
Bugenhagen
The sounds of the stars in the heavens. While this goes on, planets are born, and die.
What was that?
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. That was a scream from the Planet.
Didn't you hear it? As if to say… I hurt, I suffer…
They have come here on a journey to save the planet.
Why don't you show them your apparatus?
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. To save the planet? Ho Ho Hoooo!
Impossible. What can humans do?
Bugenhagen
But, then again, I guess it wouldn't hurt to show him.
He brought friends, too. I'll go get them.
CLOUD, please call one of them.
Only three people can fit in Grandfather's machine.
Bugenhagen!
Several odd looking people are here.
Bugenhagen
The whole place has gotten busy all of a sudden.
Bugenhagen
Don't worry. My machine won't run away. Go and invite your friends.
Bugenhagen
Here, over here. The door's unlocked, come in.
Elder Hargo
I hope great Bugenhagen will take care and not overexert himself.
'Ho Ho Hoooo.' I may be light, But I'm not as young as Nanaki.
Oops. That will only get you angry. You're just like me.  Ho ho ho.
Observatory
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. It looks like you have them all together. Then let's begin.
I'll stand there.
Observatory
So pretty…It's just like the real thing!
Wow! It's just like the real thing!
This is really somethin'!
Whew! Just like the real thing!
Woa! Wooooah! Pretty good, surprisin' me!
Bugenhagen
Hmm, yes pretty good. This is my laboratory.
All the workings of space are entered into this 3D Holographic System.
Hey! A shooting star!
Look, look! A shooting star!
Whoa! There goes a shootin' star!
Whoa! Shootin' stars!
Wh, what the? A shooting star?
Wow, how wonderful.
Oh! This is amazing!!
I'm so overwhelmed!
This's really somethin'!
Whew!!
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. Yes, it is something, isn't it?
Well, let's get to the subject.
Bugenhagen
Eventually…all humans die. What happens to them after they die?
The body decomposes, and returns to the Planet. That much everyone knows. What about their consciousness, their hearts and their souls?
Bugenhagen
The soul too returns to the Planet.
And not only those of humans, but everything on this Planet. In fact, all living things in the universe, are the same.
The spirits that return to the Planet, merge with one another and roam the Planet.
They roam, converge, and divide, becoming a swell, called the 'Lifestream'.
Lifestream… In other words, a path of energy of the souls roaming the Planet.
'Spirit Energy' is a word that you should never forget.
A new life…children are blessed with Spirit Energy and are brought into the world.
Then, the time comes when they die and once again return to the Planet…
Of course there are exceptions, but this is the way of the world.
I've digressed, but you'll understand better if you watch this.
Spirit energy is the source of life for
trees, birds, and humans.
And not only living things.
It makes it possible
to form Planets.
And if that Spirit Energy
were to disappear…
It would be the end of life as we know it.
Bugenhagen
…These are the basics of the Study of Planet Life.
If Spirit Energy disappears, our Planet will die.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. Spirit Energy is efficient BECAUSE it exists within nature.
When Spirit Energy is forcefully extracted, and manufactured, it can't accomplish its true purpose.
You're talking about Mako energy, right?
Bugenhagen
Everyday Mako reactors suck up Spirit Energy, diminishing it.
Spirit Energy is compressed in reactors and processed into Mako energy. All living things are being used up and thrown away.
In other words, Mako energy will only destroy the Planet…
Bugenhagen
The story of the planets… and those who lived with them…
If you want to know more, then you must listen to the words of the elders.
Bugenhagen
Nanaki? His father a coward?
So that's it…Nanaki's been thinking that all this time…
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. You people.
Where is Nanaki? I hope he wasn't a burden.
Ho Ho Hoooo. I'm glad you're back, Nanaki.
I hate to trouble you, but please look after Nanaki.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. That's a machine only I can use.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo.
…no time for humming now. The Planet is nearing imminent death.
But is this perhaps, what the Planet wanted? Did the Planet actually want to end like this?
I don't believe so. Were it not so, you people would still have much to do.
And myself, too. Come back whenever you are in need of my knowledge.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo.
…no time for humming now. The Planet is nearing imminent death.
Where is CLOUD? Wasn't he with you?
Cosmo Candle
Cosmo Canyon… This's where AVALANCHE was born…
I promised my guys someday… when we saved the Planet from the Shinra, that we'd all go to Cosmo Canyon and celebrate…
Biggs… Wedge… Jessie…
Now they're all gone… died for the Planet.
…Really? To save the Planet?
We all… we all hate the Shinra…
But is it right to go on?
Will they… …will they ever forgive me?
…Right now, I really don't know. But I do know one thing.
If there's anything I can do, to save the Planet…or the people livin' on it… Then I'm gonna do it!
I don't care if it's for justice or revenge, or whatever. I don't care…
Urrrrrgh! I'm gonna do it!!
Again… Again…AVALANCHE's born again!
CLOUD…
Bonfires are funny, aren't they?
They make you remember all sorts of things.
You know, CLOUD. five years ago…
…?
…It's nothing.
No, forget it. I'm afraid to ask…
What is it?
It feels like… it feels like you're going far away…
You really, really are… you…right?
I learned a lot. The elders taught me many things.
About the Cetra… And the Promised Land…
I'm…alone… I'm all alone now…
But I'm…we're here for you, right?
I know. I know, but… I am the only…Cetra.
Does that mean we can't help?
……
What a boring place, just like I thought. I wanna go somewhere! Let's go find some Materia!
I wonder how many years it's been… Gosh, it brings back memories……
…Long ago.
…When I was still very small. We were all around this flame…
No, never mind…
What happened?
It's about my parents.
When I talk about my Mother, I am full of pride and joy…
And that's fine. …But when I think of my father, my heart is full of anger…
Bugenhagen
…You really can't forgive your father?
Of course. He…left Mother for dead.
When the Gi tribe attacked, he ran off by himself, leaving Mother and the people of the Canyon!
Bugenhagen
…Come, Nanaki. There's something you should see.
…?
Bugenhagen
The place may be dangerous.
CLOUD. Will you and one other person come with us?
…
…Where're they going?
Can I go too?
I wonder what he wants to show RED XIII?
Dangerous? Count me out…
I wonder what he wants to show him? Hmm, maybe it's Materia that's been passed down for generations?
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo
Are we all set?
Yeah
Just a minute
Bugenhagen
Not ready yet? Tell me when you are ready.
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. Shall we go?
Bugenhagen
All right. Come in, come in.
Okay. You lead the way, Grandpa…
Bugenhagen
What, are you crazy? It's dangerous in there. I told you that!
You want an old man like me to go first? I'll be right behind you.
Sealed Cave
Bugenhagen
What is it? You're going back? I'll be waiting here for you when you're ready.
I can't leave this door open forever.
Bugenhagen
Good. Then we shall proceed.
Cave of the Gi
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo.
Everyone here's a Ghost of the Gi tribe, killed in a certain battle.
 A certain battle?
Bugenhagen
The vengeful spirits of the Gi didn't disappear, and couldn't return to the Lifestream…
We still have far to go. Ho Ho Hoooo.
Bugenhagen
This cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon.
Bugenhagen
If we had been attacked by the Gi here, we wouldn't have stood a chance.
…
This is a strange looking rock…
Break it open
Leave it alone
Funny looking rock…
Break it open
Leave it as is
An odd shaped rock…
Break it open
Leave it as is

Cave of the Gi
Bugenhagen
As you can see, this cave leads to the back of Cosmo Canyon.
Even though the Gi outnumbered us, they could not attack through here because the passage is too narrow.
…
Bugenhagen
Let's move on.
Received "Black M-phone"!
Received "Ether"!
Cave of the Gi
Bugenhagen
This warrior went through the cave all alone.
Bugenhagen
Fighting attackers one after another…
Grandpa… That warrior…
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo… We're almost there.
Received "Fairy Ring"!
Received "X-Potion"!
Received "Turbo Ether"!
Cave of the Gi
Bugenhagen
What is this?
Grandpa, is he?
Bugenhagen
After death… The ghosts of the Gi. Like stagnant air…
This…can't be!!
Bugenhagen
…Thank you, CLOUD. because of you, we survived.
Nanaki, you have grown strong, too.
…Oh yeah?
Bugenhagen
Now I know that it wasn't a mistake bringing you here…
Come, I have something I want to show you. Right over here.
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "Gravity" Materia!
Cet Wall
This is…
Bugenhagen
…The warrior who fought against the Gi.
He kept them from taking even one step into Cosmo Canyon.
Bugenhagen
But he was never able to return to town…
Bugenhagen
Look, Nanaki. Look at your father, at the warrior, Seto.
…That… That's…Seto?
Bugenhagen
Seto continued to fight the Gi tribe here. …To protect this Canyon.
Bugenhagen
Even after the Gi's poisonous arrows turned his body to stone…… Even after they all ran away… Seto, continued to protect us.
And he continues to protect us, even now.
Even now…
Bugenhagen
You thought that he was a coward and ran away. But he, alone risked his life to protect Cosmo Canyon.
That is your father, Seto.
That…is Seto? …!? Did Mother know?
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo…She knew. The two of them made me promise to keep this cave shut.
Bugenhagen
They asked me to seal it myself and not to tell a soul.
They said we should forget about this cave.
…
Bugenhagen
CLOUD… Would you mind leaving the two of us alone?
Bugenhagen
Nanaki. I want you to continue your journey with CLOUD and the others.
Grandpa!?
Bugenhagen
Listen, Nanaki.
Bugenhagen
CLOUD says they are trying to save the Planet.
Honestly, I don't think it can be done.
For even if they stop every reactor on the Planet, it's only going to postpone the inevitable.
Even if they stop Sephiroth, everything will perish.
Bugenhagen
But, Nanaki. I've been thinking lately.
I've been thinking if there was anything WE could do, as a part of the Planet, something to help a Planet already in misery…
Bugenhagen
No matter what happens, isn't it important to try?
Am I just wishing against fate?
Bugenhagen
I am too old to do anything about it…
This year, I'll be 130. Ho Ho Hoooo.
Bugenhagen
That is why, Nanaki, you must go with them! For my sake.
Grandpa…
Bugenhagen
I wanted to show you your real father before you left…
Bugenhagen
I'm so glad that you came back while I was still alive to show you.
Grandpa…don't talk like that. I don't want to think of life… without you…
Bugenhagen
Ho Ho Hoooo. Well, I've had a long life.
Grandpa! You must live!
I'll see to it.
I'll see to what's happening to the Planet. And I'll come back to tell you.
Bugenhagen
Nanaki…
I am Nanaki of Cosmo Canyon! The son of the warrior, Seto!
I'll come back a warrior true to that noble name! So please, Grandpa…
Bugenhagen
That's…Seto's… Seto…
Seto… Fa…Father…
Shall we get going?
So this is it, RED XIII…
That's just the way it goes. …You came in handy at times…
The buggy's fixed, so we can go now.
They said they finished fixin' the buggy.
Nibelheim
What!?
This was all burnt down, wasn't it?
…I thought so.
Then why… My house is still here too…
The hell's goin' on!? This a dream or somethin'?
…Something's strange?
I wonder what's going on…
CLOUD, maybe you were just dreaming…?
Hey, it isn't like what you told me!
What the…?
You said the whole town burnt down, right?
This is Nibelheim, right? But the town's all here.
This is Nibelheim? I heard it burnt down.
The whole town was destroyed by Sephiroth. At least that's what I heard…
Didn't you say that your hometown burned down?
I thought someone said this town burnt down!
…Yeah.
You tryin' to fool us?
Hey, what's going on?
CLOUD… Did you lie to us?
CLOUD, did you make up that story just to get our support?
Yo, CLOUD. It's not good to lie.
What happened?
I'm not lying!
I remember…the intense heat of the flames…
Wooow… He's…calling…Sephiroth… is…calling…
Got "Mind Plus!"
The…Great…Se…phi…roth… is…near..."
In…side…inside…the Mansion… Urrrrrrrgh…the great…Sephi…roth
Great…Sephi…roth… …left us…
Over…mountains… …gone…
What is it?
Nothing
I want to hear your story
I lived in this house until I was 14…
No, but this town was burned down.
You're sick, saying such things…
Get out of here!
Oh, really. Then, it'll help me too.
What's going to happen to this Planet!? What the hell's Shinra doing!?

I wonder what…this is?
Received "Elemental" Materia!
It looks like Materia, but I can't hold any more.
TIFA's secret savings, 1 gil came out of the keyboard.
I've heard this melody somewhere before. I played it well.
I have the sheet music for that song.
Huh? Wait a minute! There's something inside the music sheet.
TIFA, what's happened to our town? Was it all an illusion, or just a dream? No, it was neither. I remember trying to get people out of the flames, but not having the strength… Burning with anger, I went to the reactor to kill Sephiroth.
But he was nowhere to be found.
Instead, I found you, collapsed inside. 
I felt saving you was far more important than going after Sephiroth.
There were several others that were still alive inside, but I was only able to save you.
As I was coming out of the reactor, Shinra troops were just arriving.
I recall a scientist named Hojo was in charge. He ordered the troops to gather up everyone still alive for the experiment. I didn't know what type of experiment he was talking about, but I wasn't about to let them have my dearest student.
Putting you on my back, I headed down the mountain to the village. I used the Cure spell on you many times.
And started to head for Midgar to look for a doctor for you. I didn't like that city, and my Cure spells weren't helping.
I decided to go to Midgar to find a doctor I could trust. I'm worried about you, but I can't settle down in one place for very long.
Have you recovered fully? Are you well?
I wonder how many years have passed since then? I just got into town again, but I can't believe it… The whole town is back to normal, except for the strange people with black clothes all around.
The town reeks of Shinra, but I won't go after them. You may think I'm running from them, but it's just that I don't want anything to do with Shinra anymore. Feels like time is running out.
I'm sure you'll find this letter. And this gift for you. It should come in handy.  
I want to give it to you myself, but it's hard for my students to see me as an old man. I can't even jump anymore. But I hope you continue to sharpen your skills and remember what I taught you.
To my most precious student,  From Zangan

Periodic Report to Professor Hojo
1  Clone Activity Report
Unfortunately, no 'CLONES' have left this town this quarter. As previously reported, the 'CLONES 'seem to be sensing something.
But all they say is, 'Reunion' or 'Sephiroth' and show no other signs of activity.
2  Confidentiality Report
A total of eight people have visited this town this quarter.
Fortunately, none knew about the incident five years ago.
Therefore, no one knows the town was restored exactly as it was five years ago. Our staff, disguised as townspeople, have improved their acting skills, and we do not report any problems at this time.
That is all.
Hi, welcome.
Give me a room
What's your story?
It'll be 100 gil a night. Is that all right with you?
Yes.
Never mind.
Enjoy your stay.
You don't have enough money.
Well, maybe next time…
Oh, I'm so sorry. I've got lots to do…
This town was supposed to have burnt down five years ago.
What the hell is going on?
Sir, don't say such awful things.
I was born and raised in this town. What you say never happened.
You're lying…
EXCUSE ME! That's so rude…
If you're going to talk like that, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I'm checking the Mako boiler. Please don't bother me now.
…Welcome. It's 100 gil a night…
Spend the night.
Don't stay.

Do you have anything to do with this town?
How about bein' born and raised here?
Nope, guess not
I was here until I was 14, and I don't remember you.
…Nothing.
It's not nice to lie!!
Oh yeah?
How can you shop at a time like this?
What? Me, in business?
Don't worry, it's all right. I get paid by the company.
But my real job is protecting Nibelheim's secret.
What? Secret?
We don't have a clue. But it's all right.
It's all over anyway!
Finished, finito, over!! Even as we speak Meteor… This is the end!

Being here brings back memories.
Sephiroth
Are you going to participate in the Reunion?
I don't even know what a Reunion is!
Sephiroth
Jenova will be at the Reunion. Jenova will join the Reunion, becoming a calamity from the skies.
Jenova, a calamity from the skies? You mean she wasn't an Ancient!?
Sephiroth
…I see. I don't think you have the right to participate.
I will go North past Mt. Nibel. If you wish to know…then follow…
…Reunion? Calamity from the skies?
Hojo's Letter
I must get rid of all those that stand in the way of my research. Even that one from the Turks.
I scientifically altered him and put him to sleep in the basement. If you want to find him, search the area.
But…this is merely a game I thought of. It is not necessary for you to participate if you don't want to.

…To wake me from the nightmare
Who is it!?
…I don't know you. You must leave.
You were having a nightmare.
You were having a nightmare.
You were having a nightmare.
I woke ya up. Ya outta be thankin' me.
Aren't you glad you woke up?
You'll dream about bad things if you sleep in a place like THIS.
How bad was your dream?
…You don't look good.
Man, you really WERE having a bad dream! Even I feel bad!
The air's pretty heavy here.
How can you sleep in a place like this?
Hmph…a nightmare? My long sleep has given me time to atone.
What are you saying?
What's he talking about?
What the hell are you saying?
I have nothing to say to strangers. Get out.
This mansion is the beginning of your nightmare.
…You can say that again.
…That's for sure.
…It's startin' to look that way!
Hmm? Do you know something?
Don't say a thing
Talk about Sephiroth
Nothing I'd tell a stranger.
Nothing I feel like telling a stranger about.
Nothin' I'd tell a stranger.
Again… Do you know anything?
Nothing
Tell him about Sephiroth
I see. Then, I'll return to my nightmare…
…Do you have something to tell me?
No, good night
Tell him about Sephiroth
…Hmm.
Like you said, this mansion is the beginning of a nightmare.
Just like you said, this mansion is the start of a nightmare…
It's like you said, this mansion's the beginning of a nightmare.
No, it's not a dream, it's for real.
No, not a dream…it's reality.
No, it's not a dream, it's the truth.
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth has lost his mind. He found the secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth's gone nuts. He found a ton of secrets hidden in this mansion…
Sephiroth!?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You know Sephiroth?
You start first.
…That's how it was.
…That's how it was.
…That's how it was.
So Sephiroth knows he was created five years ago? And about the Jenova Project?
…He was missing, but has just recently reappeared.
He has taken many lives and is seeking the Promised Land.
Now it's your turn.
Now it's your turn.
Now it's your turn.
Sorry…I cannot speak.
Hey! You lyin' white-faced…
Hey, that's not right---
That's dirty!
Hmm…I'm disappointed.
What…you're serious?
Oh, that's okay. It was probably depressing anyway.
Good! I'm not in the mood to hear long stories. Let's get the hell outta here!
Hearing your stories, is yet another sin for me.
More nightmares shall come to me now, than I previously had.
Now…please leave.
…You're still here.
Good night
Who are you?
At least tell us your name.
At least tell us your name.
At least say your name.
I was with…Shinra Manufacturing in Administrative Research, also known as--the Turks.
VINCENT.
The Turks!?
The Turks!?
Turks!?
Formerly of the Turks.
I have no affiliation with Shinra now.
…And you?
CLOUD, formerly of SOLDIER.
Former SOLDIER, CLOUD.
TIFA, formerly of the AVALANCHE.
CID, formerly of the Space Program Department.
You were also with Shinra…? Then do you know Lucrecia?
Ex-AVALANCHE… Then you wouldn't know Lucrecia…
Who?
Who?
Who?
…Lucrecia.
I don't.
No.
No idea.
The woman who gave birth to Sephiroth.
…gave birth…?
Wasn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
…gave birth…?
Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
…gave birth…?
Isn't Jenova Sephiroth's mother?
That isn't completely wrong, but just a theory.
He was born from a beautiful lady.
That lady was Lucrecia.
She was an assistant to Professor Gast of the Jenova Project. Beautiful…Lucrecia.
…A human experiment?
…A human experiment?
…A human experiment?
There was no way to cancel the experiment.
I couldn't stop her.
That was my sin.
I let the one I loved, the one I respected most, face the worst.
So you started sleepin' in a box? Gimme a break!
So your punishment was to sleep? That's…strange.
So the punishment was sleep? That's weird.
So you slept as punishment? Isn't that rather strange logic?
You shouldn't sleep just because of that. Sleep?
You think that's punishing yourself? You're just sleeping.
OK. Boring story no.1.
Let me sleep…
Wait!
If I go with you, will I meet Hojo?
If I go with you, will I meet Hojo?
Dunno. But we're after him and Sephiroth. So, I guess sooner or later…
Hmm, I don't know. But we're going after Hojo and Sephiroth. So, we might……
I dunno. But we're going after him and Sephiroth. So there's a good chance…
Yeah, probably…
Yes, probably…
Yeah, probably…
Lucrecia…
All right. I've decided to go with you.
W, what?
What? You're coming with us?
What?
That sure was a quick change of heart.
What?
Hey, hold on sleepy. You're pretty damn pushy!
Huh? Oh great just what I needed…
Being a former Turk, I may be of help…
All right, then.
All right, I understand.
Alright then.
Better ask the Captain about this town. He's the one in charge of it.
Captain?
Did you see a man in a black cape?
The Captain was a pilot when Shinra was still interested in their Space Program.
He was going to be the world's first astronaut, but there was an accident…
Ever since then, he's been wasting his life away here dreaming about going into outer space.
A man in a black cape? Nope…never seen him.
This used to be a Shinra base where they used to launch rockets.
You saw the leaning rocket, right? That's Shinra No. 26. It never got off the ground though.
Everyone in this town was a mechanic back when they were planning to launch the rocket.
Rocket launch plan? What do you mean?
You don't know?
There was a plan to send a man into outer space. It was headed up by the leader of the Shinra Space Program, Palmer.
This town is the result of the plan, but the plan got cut…
Who's the 'Captain'?
Did you see a man in a black cape?
Did you meet the Captain already? He's really the town's representative, so you should really talk with him.
Welcome to the Shanghai Inn!
It's 100 gil a night. Would you like to spend the night?
Yes
No
Yes sir. Thank you!
Well then, come by again sometime.
Excuse me. Please don't come in here. Our books and the room keys are in here, so I'll have to ask you to please stay out.
The books… Maybe we could find out who's been here?
Was there a man in a black cape?
Not interested
Look, we're all adults here, so I'd appreciate it if you used some discretion.
A man with a black cape? No, no one like that has ever stayed here.
Would you like something to drink?
Let me hear your story
Not interested
CID's had some bad breaks. It's really no one's fault he couldn't go into space.
Just bad luck, I guess…
If he keeps up like that, he's gonna collapse someday. Y'know what I mean? I'm talkin' heart attack.
…That's too bad. Please come again.
A drink will ease your heart…
Welcome! This is the Item Shop.
…Hey now! I would appreciate it if you wouldn't come in.
What's that?
A rusty old rocket… Wonder why they made something so huge?
That rusted out rocket is all that remains of the Shinra's Space Program.
It just looms there. That's how the town got its name… Shinra No. 26'.
Want to look at the rocket with me?
Yeah, let's take a look
No, not interested
I get so impressed every time I look at it.
Oh, how boring…
All gramps does is gaze at that rocket all day long.
Well, he really loves machinery…
Locked
Excuse me… You don't have enough money.
Let me handle all your weapon and accessory needs!
There's a bunch of Shinra people here messin' with the rocket…
Is my rocket…all right?
The Shinra serious 'bout launching that piece of crap rocket? But why now?
…I'm in here.
Urrrrgh, urrrgh
P… Urrrrgh…aaaaaghh…
There's a lot happenin' in the world outside, but as long as I got this rocket I'm satisfied.
Anyways.
How 'bout it? Want to look at the rocket with me?
Look up
No
My, my precious rocket… It's gone.
Hmph, I know. No matter how much I look, the rocket's still gone.
But I just can't stop it. Just call it an old man's folly if you will.
What's young President Rufus doing by getting all those mechanics together?
Guard
Those terrorists are here!
Guard Captain
Don't let them get any further! Everyone, ATTACK---!
Oh, I'm getting excited.
Mmm, a SPECTACLE.
Guard Captain
Urrrgh, you're not going anywhere!" Uh un, nowhere!
Goddammit, what the hell do they think they're gonna do to my rocket!?
I'm outta here, CLOUD! I'm gonna kick those $^%$# Shinra right out of my rocket!
Wait, CLOUD!
If you're gonna kick those *#$% Shinra out of my rocket, then take me with you!
ALL RIGHT! Let's show those &$!@& Shinra!
CLOUD, what are you doin'!? They're gonna launch the rocket!!
Rude
You again?
Rude
We will eliminate everyone who gets in Shinra's way.
Rude
…They got us.
Rude
…Hmm.
What? You guys are terrorists? Wow, that's kinda exciting!
Mmm, here comes some hard action!
Hmm. Is it real or fake?
I'm so curious I can't sleep.
Mmm… I'm starting to see it now… Sorry to get you into this. For me, it's a kinda hobby.
But, out of appreciation, let me give you this.
I wish you'd take care of it and use it…
Maybe it's time for me to get a new hobby…
Oh, it's you? I heard you and the Captain really made a BANG!
I also heard that Rufus was so pissed off he went on a rampage and that no one's been able to get near him!
If things go on like this, then Meteor's just going to smash right into us and kill us all, right? …I guess that's life?
I get so restless with the rocket gone. And now that we can see Meteor clearly, …I can't stand it.
I heard Tiny Bronco broke…
That sucks. I was secretly eyeing that thing. Broke, huh? What a drag.
Look up at the sky. The bigger Meteor gets, the less time we have to live.
I still can't believe that piece of crap rocket actually made it into space…
I guess the mechanic was a genius.
Because those Shinra creeps locked us up in our houses, we couldn't even watch the rocket lift off.
I never thought that my only hobby would be destroyed by that arrogant young Rufus!
Mmm. You know that Shinra sports car at CID's house? It might be fun to try and restore that thing…
Welcome to the Shanghai Inn! Only 300 gil a night?
Yes
No
Y'know, I heard Rufus rushed back to headquarters in Midgar…
Even though they failed to blow up Meteor with the rocket, the Shinra haven't given up yet…
Looks like they're gathering all the weapons from all their bases and are preparing for a final showdown.
I heard a rumor that a Shinra airship carrying a secret weapon was attacked by a monster and sunk to the bottom of the sea…
You don't feel comfortable here? Then, everytime you look in the sky you see Meteor.
How long's that guy gonna be in the bathroom? I need to go, too…
Seems like Palmer of Shinra, Inc. ordered soldiers to restore the rocket…
Meteor's coming toward us!? And I can't even go to the bathroom…!?
OK, which is gonna happen first? Meteor hits us, or that guy comes out of the bathroom?
I'm not movin' from this spot till I see it with my own eyes.
Even with all this goin' on outside, that guy still won't come out of the bathroom? He must be a damn water tank!?
Is Gramps gonna stay like that even though rocket's gone?
Geeeeez, it's boring! Isn't anything exciting going to happen here?
Now that one of Shinra's greatest events is over, I guess it's back to the same old boring life again…
Mmm, I'm so bored. Isn't there anything that can excite me?
Even the rocket launch wasn't all THAT great.
Shera
I'll take care of everything at home. But please take care of the Captain.
Shera
What's going to happen?
Shera
Now all we have to take care of is Meteor, right? You should be able…
Excuse me… …Please take care of the Captain.
There're tons of what look
like antique guns.
…I bet the owner of this store
was a real gun fanatic.
A gun is a MAN'S weapon! Nuthin' else'll do!
Hmm, let's see… do I know any good jokes?
It's my job to make people laugh all over the world…
Hey CID! I just thought of the best joke! Listen to this one.
I'm so sick of hearing these dumb puns, but okay…let's get it over with. Go on…let me hear it.
Uh, now, let's see, how did it go?
…'He's crude an' a jerk'… I mean, He's 'Rude of the Turks'!
'President Rufus, lathers Tantrics'… Uh, I mean… President Rufus, gathers mechanics'…
'Raunchy meat, a pocket full, at the cafeteria'. Uh, I mean… Launch a beat up rocket full of Materia'.
And I thought it might be fun to hear some of your stupid puns again for old times sake… my mistake.
Oh, 'crap-again'(oh, captain).
Dammit! That does it!
How rude…
Rude, hell! You're the one who always cracks those #$##@& jokes!
Sorry, 'bout that, now lesse…
Looks like that *&%$#^$ Rufus wants to use my rocket for somethin'.
Let's go to the launching pad!
(A fearful sense of humor…)
(A fearful sense of humor…)
…??
Ugh… Nice kick.
I got to learn more… Devotion, devotion.
DAMMIT! No more of them ^$#%$@# puns!
And?
(The problem starts way before his sense of humor.)
Would you like a drink?
Let's hear your story
No thanks
Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from Corel and Fort Condor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.
I can't stand the thought of them using my rocket for something like this.
Shinra's trying to gather the Huge Materia from the Junon Underwater Reactor. There are four left, and they're transporting them here.
I can't stand them using my precious rocket for a thing like this.
Authorized personnel only.
Shera
Excuse me…CLOUD?
Shera
Did the Captain say anything?
Nope…
Shera
Welcome home.
^%$#! Shera. What are you, blind!?
We got guests!! GET SOME TEA! ^%$#!
Shera
I…I'm sorry.
Really, don't mind us.
Shut up! Sit your butts down in those chairs and drink your goddamn TEA!
Arggggggh! DAMN, I'm pissed!
…Damn, man. Wassup with that guy's attitude?
Sheesh!! What bad manners!
Poor Shera.
Who does he think he is?
Man, this sucks!
Man, he sure seems wound up tight.
…
Sorry. It's our fault.
Shera
No, no. He's always like this.
Shera
Oh?
Shera! I'll be in the backyard tunin' up Tiny Bronco!
An' make sure to serve them some tea! All right!?
He always like this? That's pretty bad!
Is it like this all the time? You keep quiet even when he's like that to you?
Is it always like this?
Why is CID so hard on you?
I think it's a bit too harsh.
Is he like this all the time? Bitin' your head off like that? I could never stand it…
What's his prob!? I'm gonna go clean that guy's clock!!
…It's amazing that you can live with it.
Shera
No… It's because of my stupid mistake.
I was the one who destroyed his dream…
What happened?
Shera
He pushed the Emergency Engine Shut Down switch, aborting the mission, to save my life.
After that, the Space Program was cut back and the launch was canceled.
It's my fault his dream was destroyed…
Shera
That's why…it's all right. I don't care what the Captain says, I'll live my life for him.
Shera! You still haven't served 'em tea!
Hurry up and sit down! Or ain't my hospitality good enough for you!?
They're late… Where is Rufus?
Palmer
Hey-HEY! Long time no see! So CID, how ya been?
Well, if it ain't fat man, Palmer. How long were you figurin' on keepin' me waitin'!?
Palmer
Hey-hey!  I don't know. The President's outside, so why don't you ask him?
^$#&! Good for nothing, fat &$#$^@!
Palmer
Don't say 'fat'!
Palmer
Hey-hey! Tea!
Can I have some too? With lotsa sugar and honey and… oh yeah, don't forget the lard!
Palmer
Hey-hey? Have we met before?
So? When's the Space Program gonna start up again?
Shera
Is President Rufus here to announce that he's going to restart the Space Program?
Palmer
Hey-hey! Is the tea ready yet?
With plenty of sugar and honey. Oh yeah, and don't forget the lard, too.
What the!? You got me all excited for nothing!?
Then, what'd you come here for?
Rufus
I want to borrow the Tiny Bronco.
&^#^%! First the Airship, then the Rocket, and now, the Tiny Bronco.
Shinra took outer space away from me and now you want to take the sky away from me too!?
Rufus
Oh my…
You seem to forget it was because of Shinra, Inc. that you were able to fly in the first place.
What!?
Shera
Uh, excuse me…
Shera
This way…
Shera
You wanted to use the Tiny Bronco, right?
Shera
I believe Palmer's going to take it. Why don't you talk to him?
Rufus
We're going after Sephiroth. But seems like we've been going in the wrong direction.
But now, we think we know where he's headed. But, we have to cross the ocean. That's why we want your plane…
What're you guys doin' here?
We heard the Captain was here.
Captain? I'm the Captain!
The name's CID. Everyone calls me 'Captain', though.
What d'ya want?
Tell me about this rocket
Is Rufus coming?
Can we borrow the "Tiny Bronco"?
Wow! Not bad for a kid.
Alright then, I'll explain it to you.
You know Shinra developed a lot of technological gadgets during the meaningless war, right?
Now it's a Mako company, but in the old days it was a weapons manufacturer.
Well, they came up with a Rocket Engine.
There was so much excitement about the thought of going into outer space. Our dreams got bigger and bigger.
They put a major budget into it and made prototype after prototype! Finally, they completed Shinra No. 26.
They chose the best pilot in Shinra… no, in the world--me. I mean, come on.
And finally we get to the day of the launch. Everything was goin' well…
But, because of that dumb-ass Shera, the launch got messed up. That's why they became so anal!
And so, Shinra nixed their outer space exploration plans.
After they told me how the future was Space Exploration and got my damn hopes up…DAMN THEM!
Then, it was all over once they found out Mako energy was profitable. They didn't even so much as look at space exploration.
Money, moola, dinero! My dream was just a financial number for them!
Look at this rusted Rocket. I was supposed to be the first man in space with this.
Everyday, it tilts a little bit more.
At this rate, I don't know which'll be first, this thing falling over or me gettin' outta here.
Yeah! It must be news about restarting the Space Program.
A young President, that's what we needed! He still has dreams, too!
You out of your *&$^$# mind!? That's my most cherished possession. I can't let you take it.
Ummm… Just look around.
My last hope is to talk to the President.
Hey! Get your ass in gear! You work like a snail!
Even the moon'd get tired waitin' around for your ass!
Shera
I'm…I'm sorry.
Don't take so much time checkin' that *%$^# oxygen tank!
Shera, bein' careful's good, but no matter how many times you check that oxygen tank, it won't matter.
That thing wouldn't break even if hell froze over.
Shera
But…
No buts!!
You're not stupid, so be more efficient!
Shera
I'm sorry…
Instrument panel…all clear. Shinra No. 26, ready for launch.
Control
Engine pressure rising. Shinra No. 26, 3 minutes to launch. Beginning countdown.
…Finally.
What the? What happened!?
Control
CID! We have an emergency situation!
A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
What!? Who is the little ^%$@!?
Control
I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Hey goddammit!! Who the &%$#'s still in there?
Shera
It's Shera, Captain. Don't mind me, go ahead with the launch.
Shera!? What are you still doin' in there!?
Shera
I was still concerned. The results of the oxygen tank test weren't satisfactory.
You stupid little $#^%!
It's gonna get so hot in there that there ain't gonna be #$!% left when we blast off!
You're gonna be burnt to a crisp! You're gonna die! You know that, doncha!?
Shera
I don't mind.
If I can just fix this, the launch will be a success. I'm almost done.
Almost done!? You're gonna die!
Control
CID, We must start the countdown. We won't make it if we don't!
Control
What are you going to do, CID? If we cancel now, it'll be another six months until the next launch!
Control
Starting engine!
GODDAMMIT, Shera… you wanna make me a murderer?
Shera
Tank Number 7 check is complete. Once I complete Tank Number 8, it's all clear.
Oh man, the moon…outer space… my dreams…
Control
Ignite Engine!
Control
15 seconds until ignition. Internal temperature rising.
SH-------#%!!
Captain! Our dreams are finally coming true!
We are so proud to be a part of the launch of Shinra No. 26.
All right, Captain! Fly our dreams into outer space!
Yeah! Leave it all to me! I'll be back in a few!
We're praying for your safety!
Captain, preparations are complete! All that's left is lift off!
Thanks, guys!
Hey, wait a minute! Shera's still in here!
Shera
Captain!
Shera!?
Control
30 seconds until ignition. Beginning countdown.
Control
CID! Forget about her. We won't make it in time!
Come on, Shera…hurry up… You're gonna die…
What…what am I… What am I supposed to do?
There's a Shinra logo on it. Tiny Bronco… This is cool.
Shinra always keeps the best things for themselves. Let's take it!
I wonder if we can borrow it…
Let's take it, OK CLOUD?
Will it fly? Is it all right to just take it?
CLOUD! If we steal it, we'll get in deep trouble!
…Want me to keep watch?
CLOUD, let's steal it! I love stealing from the Shinra!
Um…may I help you?
No… We're just looking at it.
…If you would like to use it, please ask the Captain. The Captain should be in the rocket.
I'm Shera. And what are your names?
I'm CLOUD.
I'm BARRET, of AVALANCHE.
TIFA. Nice to meet you.
I'm AERIS.
Nanaki, otherwise known as RED XIII.
Fortune telling machine CAIT SITH, here.
VINCENT. I am…nevermind.
I'm YUFFIE!
Shera
Hmm… So you're not with the Shinra?
I thought you were bringing approval for the Space Program.
…!?
Shera
President Rufus is scheduled to come here. The Captain's been so restless all morning.
Rufus!!?
Palmer
Hmm… Why do I have to do this…? I'm the head of the Space Program…
Palmer
I've seen you somewhere before…
Palmer
I know! The Shinra building! When the President was killed! Ulp!
We'll be taking the Tiny Bronco.
Palmer
Se…se…security!!
I can't stop it!
I can't stop it!
I can't stop it!
It's taking off.
No! It's taking off!
No!! It's gonna take off!
I can't stop…
Forget it! Get in!!
All right, here we go!
Gimme that!
I want to try it!
I wanna try!
Leave it to me.
Let me handle it.
Let me be the pilot!
I'll do it.
CID! Get on!
Godammit! What are you amateurs doing!
Rufus
CLOUD!? Don't let 'em get away! Shoot 'em down!
%#^@!! The tail's been hit!
Emergency landing…
This's gonna be a big splash. Hold on to your drawers and don't piss in 'em!
She won't fly anymore.
Can't we use it as a boat?
$#&%! Do whatever you want!
CID, what will you do now?
I dunno. I'm history with the Shinra and I've given up on that town.
How about your wife? Shera?
Wife? Don't make me laugh! Just thinkin' 'bout marryin' her gives me the chills.
What're you guys gonna do?
We're going after a man named Sephiroth. We'll have to get Rufus of the Shinra someday too.
I don't know about any of that, but…
What the hell!? Sign me up!
How 'bout it, everyone?
I don't care.
Of course, no problem!
I'm all for it.
I don't really care.
I don't mind.
Whatever!
…Do whatever you like.
Glad to be aboard, numbskulls!
Numbskulls…?
Yeah. Anyone stupid enough to go up against Shinra nowadays, has GOTTA be a numbskull! I like it!
So, where we headed?
Rufus was goin' after Sephiroth to the Temple of the Ancients.
Really!?…Where is it? That Temple of the Ancients?
Dunno. That numbskull kid was tellin' me he was headin 'The wrong direction'… so maybe it's off this way?
Let's just head for land and get some information. Temple of the Ancients… that name bothers me.
…Hm. How 'bout goin' west?
No, no reason. NO reason at all!
Wilderness
Wait, wait, wait, wai----t!!
What!? What happened all of a sudden?
What!? The hell happened all of a sudden!?
What the--? Did something happen?
What happened all of a sudden? Don't scare me like that!
Wh, wh, what is it, all of a sudden!? Don't scare me like that!
What the HELL is it! Shoutin' out and jumpin' in front of me all of a sudden!
What happened all of a sudden? Did something happen?
I know this area pretty well.
It gets pretty tough past here. Better get ready…
…Hmmm… Something's fishy…
You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?
……Hmmm… Something's fishy…
You're not planning something sneaky again, are you?
Hah, I know what you're thinkin'. And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?
…You serious? And you sayin' that just now means you're up to somethin'! Right!?
I don't trust you.
…Really? Somehow, I don't believe it.
Are you trying to con us again?
…Really? Something tells me I shouldn't trust you.
Are you going to trick us again?
Hmm… Smells fishy.
Are you going to trick us again?
Hmm… Smells fishy.
My nose never lies!
You serious? I can't trust you.
But then again, I guess I shouldn't talk.
Hey! You serious?
If you're trying to con us, you won't get away with it!
Further down? I don't see any signs of danger…
There's something unnatural in the way YUFFIE's acting…
No! It's REALLY tough…
There they are, catch 'em!!
Shinra!?
Shinra!?
The Shinra!?
The Shinra!!
That's Sh…Shinra's…
What, the Shinra!?
It's Shinra!!
The Shinra!
Shinra Soldier
Hey, that's not them! These are the other guys from before!!
YUFFIE, did you by any chance…
YUFFIE, so you're…
YUFFIE, you're not…
So you were, YUFFIE!!
Not bad, YUFFIE, not bad at all.
YUFFIE! You sure got some nerve, kid!
So what does this mean? You will explain later.
I didn't know! I had nothing to do with this one!
This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?
So you WERE up to something!
Whaddya mean 'this one'!? This one'?
So you WERE plannin' somethin'!!
This one? Did you just say 'THIS one'?
So you WERE trying something!
What do you mean 'this one'? THIS one'?
So you were concocting some evil scheme!!
This one? What do you mean 'THIS one'?
So you were planning on tricking us!
Whaddya mean 'THIS one'? THIS one'!?
So you WERE planning some crooked $%*&!!
What do you mean, 'This one'?
You had something else in mind?
No, umm, uh…
Shinra Soldier
What should we do!?
Shinra Soldier
Uh…Get them! Grab them and ask questions later!!
What's going on!?
I thought something was missing… my Materia's all gone!!
The hell's goin' on!?
I knew somethin' was missing. All my Materia's gone!!
What's going on!?
I thought something was odd… My, my Materia is missing!!
What's going on?
I thought something was funny, my Materia's disappeared!!
What's going on!?
Something's missing…my Materia…it's gone!!
What the hell's goin' on?
I knew I was missing something… My Materia's gone!!
I thought something was wrong. So that's it.
My Materia's been stolen…
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Yo…where's that $#@^% YUFFIE?
Hey…where's YUFFIE?
Now…where's YUFFIE?
Ey…where the hell's that damn kid?
…
I'm SO mad!!
That &*&$ kid!!!
Grrrrrgh!! Arrrrrgh Uhhhhhhhhhhhh!!
She's done it again!!
I'll never forgive her!
ZOUNDS!!
Grrrrrrrgh… Grrrgh! Grrrrrgh!!
She's done it again!
She sure took us for fools!
That little ^%#^$@!!
Takin' me for a fool!!
Inexcusable…
She was probably eyeing our Materia from the beginning.
It looks like she went North. Let's hurry after her and get our Materia back!
She was after our Materia from the start!!
She went North! When I get my hand on her, I'll get our Materia back!
C'mon! We're goin' after her!
She was after our Materia from the beginning.
She won't get away with this! I'm pretty sure she ran off North. Let's go after her!!
Her objective was stealing our Materia from the beginning.
…sniff… North! She ran off to the North!
I'm not going to let her get away with this! Hurry, hurry! We have to get our Materia back!
She must've been after our Materia from the beginning.
We can't just let her get away, right? Then, let's hurry after her! Which way? It's North, the North! It's a message from the stars!
No doubt about it! That kid was after our Materia from the start!!
Hmm… Looks like she went North.
Don't drag your asses! We're going right NOW! That $#@^% is history!!
Seems as though all that she was after was our Materia.
We can't just let her get away. She ran to the North…
We must go after her and retrieve our Materia back.
Hey, we gotta problem! Our Materia's all gone!!
O…OH NO! All of our Materia…gone!?
Wutai
Hey!!
Life is just like a river. It flows from the large ocean of life, and eventually it returns back to it.
Wutai is a historical place. There are some very unusual things here you should see.
YUFFIE? I saw her a while ago. She must be in one of the houses around here.
Materia is like Life. They both come from the large ocean of life, and both must return to it.
Life is like the dew on the leaves of the trees. Whether Meteor falls or not is no more than a fleeting glimmer.
Lord Godo is in this house.
He used to be quite strong, but now, all he does is sleep…
What, YUFFIE… It's best to ask Lord Godo about that.
But today he's not in the best of… Well, I should say… But really he's not so…
Anyhow, for some reason YUFFIE's had a fondness for Materia ever since I can remember.
She's always hung around places she thought might have it. That's just how she is. Sometimes she'll just bust into people's houses.
Other times she'll hide in the shadows just like a little kid.
That reminds me, lately I've seen a kid around here that reminds me of YUFFIE.
Always sneakin' around corners and doin' somethin' she shouldn't.
She's always getting into fights. I guess she takes after Godo that way.
Like father like daughter…
Two girls just went off towards Da-chao. I wonder if that place is popular with the kids now?
One had herself all tangled up in a rope. And the other one kind of looked like YUFFIE.
Hm, money? There's all kinds of money.
This type and that… Hey now that you mention it, there was some money over there.
The end is right in front of us…
But what can you do about it? Just go on living your life, day in and day out…
Alright, alright, alright! I know!
On the side of the mountain, right there in your face is Da-chao!
I hear you can climb to the top, but since it's dangerous I'd be mighty careful if I were you!
A girl with Materia? No, there hasn't been anyone climbing Da-chao for some time now.
You know I've noticed that there's a pounding noise from time to time in this store.
Why Da-chao? Alright, alright, alright! I don't know!
Alright, alright, alright! I saw an old man in flashy clothes running towards Da-chao!
He was babblin' somethin' and looked like he was floatin'! He almost bowled me over!
When that big star bashes into us, both Wutai and Da-chao are going to be dust! Can't we do anything?
This is MY house! Nobody gets in!
You can't get away, YUFFIE.
Give it up, YUFFIE!
You lost, YUFFIE.
O…OK, I know… I was wrong…
You win. I'll give you back your Materia…
I don't think she came out from here… Is that OK?
Wait, that damn YUFFIE's gotta be somewhere in this cheap town! You jus' gonna leave?
Knowing YUFFIE, she's still hidden somewhere in town. You sure?
I know she hasn't left town! You still want to leave?
You lettin' that damn kid off the hook? I know she's gotta be hiding around here somewhere!
She couldn't have left town… I think she is must still be here. Or, do you want to go on?

Well, well. Long time no see. What have you been up to? Let's see…what was your name?
No, Gramps! This isn't anyone you know! This is just some stranger who barged into our house!
Oh, how exciting. You a friend of my grandson's?
No, Gramps! These guy's are creepy! They're runnin' all over the place!
Oh, you know lately things have been like that. You can even see the moon at noon. Everyone's celebrating.
No, Gramps! That's a big red planet in the sky! Everyone's scared of it!!

What are we going to do, Gramps? Some strange-looking girl came in here a minute ago and I…
Oh no! More weirdos!
No, these aren't like the one from a while ago, but these ones look weird, too!

Elena
Yy, you!? How did you get here?
Never mind that. I guess it's fate that brought us together.
Get ready to die!!
Reno
Elena, you talk too much.
Elena
Ww, what?
Reno
What are we doing way out here in the middle of nowhere?
Elena
We're taking a vacation and resting up from our work.
Reno
Now our vacation is ruined.
Elena
B, but…
Rude
Even the booze tastes bad now.
Elena
…Sorry…
Reno
Drink, Rude! How long have we been a team?
Being a Turk's been hard at times, but all in all, I'm glad I did it.
After all, I got to meet a bunch of wing nuts like you.
Rude
To the Turks… To Reno…cheers!
Elena
Hmm, you're lucky all right. Now get out of my sight!
The next time we meet I won't be so nice.
Hey, hey, welcome! You on a trip? Well, just relax and make yourself at home.
Nowadays, Wutai's just able to get by thanks to the tourists.
Seems like the town got really lively since you arrived. Did anything happen?
First the ground started shaking, then that large star…
Y, you think… It's all over?
Hey. You think the store feels gloomy?
Let's just say that I like things quiet.
It's been really loud and busy outside.
Someone outside must be up to something bad…
Hey. Things look pretty sad around here.
With things the way they are in the world I guess there's nothing I can do about it.
Running around like a fool won't help matters any. So, we all might as well sit back and have a beer…
Shinra soldier
So our reports were right! He IS here on vacation!
We've finally found him! Get the Turks here for back-up!
Reno
…What a drag.
Shinra soldier
Ww, what was that?
Reno
We're off duty now and can't save your butts.
Shinra soldier
We know you're off duty, but…
If you knew, then don't bother us! Lookin' at you is makin' me sober.
Shinra soldier
But you all have orders from headquarters to look for him too!
All right, fine! We'll get him without any help from the Turks, just you see!
Shinra soldier
And don't think that headquarters isn't going to hear about this!!
Elena
Reno, do you think that was really such a good idea!?
I mean is that the way a professional, a Turk, would act!?
Reno
Elena. Don't misunderstand.
Those who sacrifice themselves for their job aren't pros… …just fools.
Elena
Rude?
Rude
…
Elena
Well, I don't buy that! Goodbye!!
Reno
Relax. She's not a child. Let her have her way.
Reno
… It's just that we're off duty!
I don't feel like drinking with you. And don't talk to me.
Hey. Did you hear? There used to be a Water God here in Wutai.
They say the Water God was a huge snake!
Now we live in a world filled with Mako. Not many people would believe in something like that now.
But some in the world, and here in Wutai, still believe.
Believe in the scales of the Water God and in Materia that has its power in it.
Congrats! You have just found all six flyers for the "Turtle's Paradise"! 
How wonderful! Now here is your prize, just as we promised!!
Please come again to "Turtle's Paradise"! We're looking forward to seeing you!
Wutai‚Pagoda
That five-storied pagoda over there is called the Pagoda of the Five Mighty Gods…
The Five Gods are Power, Speed, Magic, War and Omni. Omni has the best of the others.
For generations, we in Wutai have worshipped Da-chao the Water God.
Legend has it that the village has been protected by Da-chao, the Water God, and the Five Mighty Gods.
But, in the last battle, we didn't fare so well… I guess our beliefs were only based on legend.
Have you ever heard of the Water God's scales?
They're not just regular scales. They have special hidden powers. They're impervious to the strongest flames.
But, of course, I don't think they'd stand up to the fire that huge eerie-lookin' Meteor's gonna make when it crashes down.
Reno
Hmm… Corneo's good at escaping…
Rude
…Elena.
Reno
Let's go, Rude. We'll give them a taste of what the Turks can do.
Reno
That sounded okay.
Reno
If he has Elena, that's going to make things a little difficult.
And uh…
…OK. Corneo took YUFFIE from us.
And without YUFFIE, there's no way we'll get our Materia back.
…All right. Corneo stole YUFFIE from us as well.
And without her, there's no way we'll get our Materia back.
That's just beautiful! And now that *#$^@'s walked off with YUFFIE too!
And without that brat, we can't get our hands on our Materia!
Reno
Don't misunderstand.
We have no intention of joining you. We're only agreeing not to fight each other…for now.
That's fine. We have no intention of cooperating with you, either.
Now, uh, which direction did Corneo run off?
The same goes for us. We don't want to make friends with the Turks.
Now, which direction did Corneo run off?
Of course! There ain't no way we'd wanna work with the Turks anyway!
Anyhow, which direction did that %^$*& run off?
Reno
Hmm, nice attitude. Here's a clue, it's the most obvious place.
Wutai‚Main Mtn.
Godo
GOOGAH…what do you want?
Godo
Don't have…GAH…anything much but, you should be able to…GOO…rest yourselves here. GOGAH…make yourselves at home.
Godo
…YUFFIE? …Nope, never heard of her. …GOOGO…
Godo
…You again? I said it once, and I'll say it again, I don't know her.
Godo
Listen, I said I didn't know her! There isn't anyone named YUFFIE here in Wutai!
Godo
…Never seen you around here before…
Lately, I've been seeing a lot of Shinra soldiers around here…You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Godo
I don't care about who you are.
But, if you're in trouble with the Shinra, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
I don't want the Shinra hanging around here looking over my shoulder.
What's with you, you coward?
Godo
YUFFIE!
You scared of the Shinra?
Then why don't you just bow down and obey them like all the other towns?
Those guys are the ones who are really fighting the Shinra!
Godo
Shut up! What would you know about this?
You got beat once, so what? That's it? What happened to the mighty Wutai I used to know?
Godo
No kid like you's going to talk to me like that!
You keep acting like that! You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
That's my style! And it's my business, not yours! Don't try and dictate what I should do!
Godo
Style? Dictate?
Why all those fancy words? You're a rotten daughter!
Hmph! You're a sad excuse for a father!!
Godo
…Take your things and get out of here now.
For the good of Wutai, we cannot stand up to Shinra.
Shinra soldier
Now listen up! They must be in the area! Find them no matter what!
Yes, sir!!

Item/Accessory Store
Hey yo! Welcome!
We got some of the best blades right out of the furnace! So strike while the iron's hot!
Hey yo! Welcome!
You aren't tired of my rambling?
Great! Then come on in and start buying!
Sorry, but we're entirely sold out now.
What's this here? Ah, no…that's uh…
…A sample! Yeah, that's it…a sample. Sorry, but why don't you all come back later?
Listen, I'm sorry about last time. YUFFIE told me not to sell anything to you.
[DOESN'T EXIST]
This is a weapon store of hard cores, by hard cores, and for the hard cores! Come on and take a look, why doncha!?
Sorry, listen I… No, nothing…never mind.
Item Store
Stole "MP Absorb" Materia!
Received "MP Absorb" Materia!
We got a lot of different stuff here. Take what you want.
You're still gonna sit here and buy stuff at a time like this?
You're an odd one…
I'm sorry. The sign outside says "Materia", but there's almost no Materia left anywhere in Wutai.
Listen, this is just a backwoods town. We don't have much to do with Shinra, and besides…
If we had a lot of Materia, Wutai would be a much more exciting town, but we don't…
And now it's too late to be worrying about Materia at this stage of the game…
If you see anything you need, buy it.
Huh? What? You DID?
Oh, no, no, no! I'm just replacing these goods! You come back later.
YUFFIE's House
I know, the Materia, right? I have it stored in a safe place. …Follow me.
YUFFIE's House
…I've been hearing that ever since I was little.
Before I was born, Wutai was a lot more crowded and more impressive.
You see what it looks like now, right? …Just a tourist trap…
After the war, we got peace, but we lost something else. Now look at Wutai…
That's why… if I had lots of Materia I could…
Listen, YUFFIE. I don't care about the history of Wutai or your feelings.
You've got our Materia and I want it back…now.
If you give it back now, we'll drop the whole thing.
I'm sorry, YUFFIE. I know how you feel, but we need Materia, too.
…We just can't let you have it. Please understand.
YUFFIE
Dammit, YUFFIE. We ain't got time to be listening to your life story.
If you want Materia, get it yourself. That's how you should do it.
I know. I know that…
That…sniff…switch… the lever on the left…… Materia's…sniff, hic…in there.
Don't make a mistake. The left lever…
I'm sorry, but……
Ain't nuthin' we can do about it…
Now, the Materia…
Were we a little too harsh on her?
Well, let's get our Materia back.
Hmmph… I dunno.
There was nothing else to do.
Wh…what the hell is this?
Eyaaaaah!
Eyaaaaah!
Wh, what are you doing?
Wh, what is this?
Whoa!
!?
Ha, ha--! You should've listened!!
Ha, ha, ha--! Never trust anyone that easily!!
The Materia's mine! Tough!
You want your Materia? Then go find it yourself!
Yeah that's right. And when you're looking for the Materia, remember you gotta steel it.
Heh heh… Steel…steel! Get it?
C'ya!!
Y, yo, wait up!!
Wait, don't leave us!
W..wait, don't leave us here!
Help us first!
Hey, help us…please!
Hey! Help me first!
Wait, don't go by yourself!

You're finally here. We're gonna split up.
You do whatever you want. But don't endanger Elena.
Don't worry. We won't do anything to that girl, YUFFIE.
For now…
Rude
……
Reno
Stop fooling around. The enemy's not gonna wait for us, you know!
Reno
You all thought they might be here too, huh?  We were way off.
There's no way they could get this far.
Whoa!!
Can't go through here… That flame would fry me in an instant.
Eyaaaah!
There is no way past this!
Damn, that's hot!
I like hot baths, but this is TOO hot!
"The Scale of the Sea God" shines!
LET…ME……GO!!!!
Corneo
Hmm! Delicious…scrumptious! I think I've just found a new HOBBY!
Corneo
Which shall it be? Hmm…Hmm…
Corneo
Should I take…HER?
Elena
He…hey, I'm a 'Turk'! Don't think you can get away with this!!
Corneo
Or…maybe…HER?
Oh GAWD! If I knew this was gonna happen, I would've taken those rope lessons more seriously!!
Corneo
Hmm!!! I've made my choice! My companion for the night will be…
Corneo
…the cheerful one!
GROSS-NESS!
Don't mess with me old man! You don't even have any Materia!
Corneo
Oooooh! And she's saucy, too! Wheee! Wheee!
All right, that's it!!
Hold it right there!
Hey, hey, hey! That's as far as you go!
Corneo
Hee-haw. What…what's goin' on!? Who's there?
Oh man! CLOUD……!
Oh man! TIFA……!
Oh man! That old fart, CID!
Corneo
Wheeel…long time no see.
Don't tell me you forgot…
That fall into the trap really hurt!
You just don't get it, do you…!?
Corneo
Hmm…Who are you guys!?
Maybe God'd forgive an ugly ^#@# like you, but I won't!
 You damn Midgar hyena…!
Hurry and let the two go!
I don't care what you're doing, so much as the idiotic way you're doing it…
Listen you stupid, slimy, sleazy old scab bag! If you want to get women, there's such a thing as the RIGHT way!
Corneo
Be quiet! None of you know how much I've suffered since then…
Corneo
It's a long story, but……
We don't want to hear it! Just let them go!
I don't really give a damn! You're gonna let them go, or else I'm gonna break your arm!
I don't really care! Let YUFFIE and Elena go!
Corneo
Hmm…You guys are serious. …Good, good.
…this time I'm not fooling around either…
Corneo
Why did you kill my little Aps?
I'm gonna make you PLAY with my new pet, so you won't interfere in my search for a bride!
Corneo
RAPPS---come here!!
Corneo
Wait…
Just wait a second!
SHUT UP!
You better say your prayers!
Don't be such a poor loser, old man!
Corneo
Just listen to me - it won't take long.
Why do you think a bad guy like me would swallow his pride and plead for his life?
1  Because he's ready to die
2  Because he's sure to win
3  Because he's clueless
Corneo
Hmm…WRONG!
Corneo
Hmm…RIGHT!
Corneo
Hmm…Close, but no!
Elena
Eyaaaah…
It makes me so MAD!
Corneo
Once I push this button, they'll fall and we'll have SQUASHED TOMATOES!
Damn!
Coward!
So this is how a loser lives!
Damn tricky $#%@&T$*^%$ !
All right…
Grrrrrgh…
You sure are vulgar!
……!
Corneo
Now, give me your women too!
Corneo
Ha, ha, ha, ha! I guess I have the last laugh!
No, that would be us.
Corneo
…The Turks!
Reno
You knew this was gonna happen ever since you leaked that secret.
We're going to take care of you… personally.
Corneo
DAMMIT! Then they're all comin' with me!
Corneo
Ugh…!
Reno
Good timing, Rude.
Rude
…Let's get to work.
Reno
All right, Corneo. This'll be over quick, so listen up.
Why do you think we went to all the trouble of teaming up with those guys to get you…?
1.  Because we're ready to die
2.  Because we're sure of victory
3.  Because we're clueless
Corneo
Two…Number two?
Reno
All wrong.
Corneo
No! Wait, st…
Corneo
Aaaaaaaaaa……p
Reno
The correct answer was…
Rude
…because it's our job.
Elena
Oh, thank you very much…!
I never thought you'd come…
Reno
Elena, don't act so weak.
You're a Turk!
Elena
Y…Yes, sir!
Th…Thanks.
Thanks for your help.
I uh, thanks for today.
Never thought you'd ever help us…
You guys have some good in you.
It would appear thanks are in order…
I'll just say you…helped.
Reno
Yes…this is Reno.
Yes…Yes… I'll get on it right away.
Elena
Was that the company?
Reno
Yeah, they want us to find CLOUD…
Rude
Are we on?
Reno
No, today's our day off.
Hey---who cares about that!? Get----me-----down----!
…
Freeze!
You aren't from Wutai, are you?
No
Yes
Only those from Wutai may enter the tower!
I'll have to ask for you to leave!
Hey! I can't stand liars! Leave this tower at once!
Oh, Miss YUFFIE! Will you be climbing the pagoda today?
Yeah
No way!
Then I, Sacred Gorky, will be your opponent on the first floor!
Miss YUFFIE! You cannot go on to the second floor unless you defeat me!
Yo! They call me Shake! I'll be watchin' your fight with Gorky!
Gorky
Then, begin!
Gorky
Power Change!
Gorky
Here I am, Miss YUFFIE!
Shake
Hmm, I thought you were just a girl, but you handled that pretty good!
Let's see how you do on next one…
Gorky
In my opinion, you need more training! Gorky is disappointed!
Shake
No good! You have to beat Gorky! Are you mocking this Pagoda?
Of course!
Shut up! Shut up! SHADDUP!
Who's next?
Shake
Are you blind? I'm right here!
What? I gotta fight a punk?
Shake
Heh! Punk. I'm more of an adult than some bimbo girl!
Wh, what did you say!?
Shake
See what I mean? That kind of anger's what makes you so immature!
Don't pat yourself on the back until you beat me!
Now watch…!
Shake
'bout the only thing you do really good is breathe! Are you sure you wanna fight?
Stop yappin'!
I'll forgive you
Hm, so someone finally got past Gorky.
I guess it's Chekhov's turn…
Shake
Here I go, brat! Speed Change!
Shake
URRGRAAAAGH! So you CAN fight a bit!
Shake
HYAAAAAAH! BRATBRATBRATBRAT!!
Shake
You don't belong here! This is the Wutai Temple of Martial Arts!
Shake
Hey, you there! Don't ignore me!
Shake
So you're just talk after all. Brat!
Chekhov
You can't go to the next floor unless you beat Shake.
Chekhov
Ho, ho, ho… It's been a while since I felt pain…
So even Shake's been defeated. It's been a while since you had to fight, eh Chekhov?
Chekhov
Unfortunately, this is as far as it goes.  Staniv, you watch over there.
That ain't going to happen! I'll teach you about the strength of youth!
Chekhov
Keep mouthing off like that, little girl, and you're going to get burned.
I got insurance.
Let's get this over, ya' old geez.
Chekhov
Ho, ho, ho. We'll see if you still talk like that after you taste some of my Sacred Magic…
Chekhov
Ho, ho, ho. What do you expect from a child barely out of diapers!?
Chekhov
Magic Change!
Chekhov
I can't believe…you beat me.
Staniv
This should be interesting! It's been too long since I've had a chance to use my full power…
Chekhov
Ho, ho, ho! What does a immature child know…?
Staniv
This is the average person's limit?
Chekhov
That being the case, we have nothing further to discuss.
Chekhov
How dare they mock us, thinking they could sneak past us.
Staniv
First, Chekhov will keep you company…
Staniv
So you're here…
Huh? Who am I supposed to beat?
Staniv
HAAAAH!
Staniv
The rule is the best fighter on each floor will be your opponent… This is a five-storied pagoda,but the fourth floor is the highest…
In other words, no one has ever defeated me--Master of Weaponry!
You still want to try…?
Just come on!!
I'll pass!
Staniv
I like you! Now watch…
Staniv
Weapon Change!
Staniv
How unfortunate! It was over before I could even put all my strength into it…
Staniv
Wh, what…!?
Gorky
Splendid! You have definitely improved…
Shake
Oh, ho! You might not be as much of a child as we thought you were!
Chekhov
Of course. If WE lost to her…
Staniv
You have defeated four of our best, but now you will have to face HIM!
Staniv
If it were not for Miss YUFFIE, I wouldn't be facing him…
Staniv
You didn't seem like someone who could get to the fourth floor so easily…
D,…Dad!?
Godo
I'm glad you made it this far, YUFFIE!
Why, why are you……
Godo
I'll answer you by having you try your skills against me!
Hold nothing back. Come as if you're trying to kill me! If you don't…then I'll have to kill you!
Dammit……
Godo
Ohhh! And what was that!? Come back when you get more training!
I'll show you this time, you old Fart-meister!
Godo
Hmm? A slight improvement.
Godo
Come at me with all you have! OMNI-Change!!
H…hey!
Godo
What are you doing! OMNI-Change!!
…heave…heave…
Godo
…huff…puff…
O…old coot… not…bad…
Godo
You've…also…improved…
Hah…Ha, ha…
Godo
…Heh, heh…
Ha ha haaaaaa!
Godo
Waha haaaaa!
Godo
It's time I gave this to you, YUFFIE…
This is Leviathan Materia. Take it.
Godo
…I thought I'd give it to you, but you have no room for it.
Then, come back for it later. And don't forget!
Godo
Leviathan Materia? Oh! So you DID remember.
Well it's yours, go ahead and take it!
You have too much Materia!
Staniv
But, Lord Godo. Leviathan Materia should only be given to the person who conquers and takes over this Pagoda. That is our custom…
CUSTOM, CUSTOM, CUSTOM… I'm so sick of hearing that!
It's so stupid!
Gorky
Silence, Miss YUFFIE!
Then what 'bout all of you? With all your power…
Are you satisfied being cooped up in this tower?
Godo
YUFFIE!
You too, Dad! Just because you lost the war,
You turned Wutai into a place like this!
Chekhov
What do you mean?
You turned Wutai into a cheesy resort town peddling to tourists…
How dare you!? Da-chao Statue and Leviathan are ashamed!!
Godo
…
Shake
She IS a kid.
Wh, what did you say?
Godo
YUFFIE!!
Godo
Forgive me… It's all my fault…
Gorky
What are you saying, Lord Godo!
Godo
Losing the war…turning Wutai into this. It was all my fault…
Chekhov
Lord Godo!
Godo
Silence!!
Godo
YUFFIE……
I am the same now as I was before when I wanted war.
But, after losing, I began to think…
Is strength for beating enemies
…or just something to show-off?
Might begets might.
The same as Shinra.
……
Godo
I knew you were looking for Materia for the good of Wutai.
But, the reason I hide my strength now, is also for the good of Wutai…
And now, I realize both are necessary…
Strength without determination means nothing. And determination without strength is equally useless…!
Staniv
Lord Godo…
Godo
You there, please take YUFFIE with you!
I perceive that you all have both determination and strength!
Well, just tell yourself you're on a big ship, and leave the rest to ol' CID!
If you put it that way, we can't refuse…
As long as she doesn't interfere!
All right. We'll take her with us.
…after that, how can we refuse?
Hmm… You may come if you want to …
Jus' don't do nothin' funny to our Materia…!
All right, I don't mind.
Godo
Go, YUFFIE!
For the sake of Wutai!
Dad…
Godo
I'll take care of the Five Sacred Gods until you return!
Go! And come back alive!
Duh!
Godo
YUFFIE, wait a minute.
Godo
After their battle is over…
Do you think they'll still want all their Materia?
Dad…!
Godo
Go! Fight till the end! But come back!
With the Materia!
Heh, heh…you bet!
Staniv
Miss YUFFIE. Your feelings for Wutai are the same as Lord Godo's. Always remember that…
Staniv
Please take care of Miss YUFFIE.
Chekhov
Never bring shame on Wutai.
Chekhov
She's always like this. It'll be rougher on you.
Shake
You say there's some unusual Materia where the underground pipe is!?
But, first you gotta get if from a monster and unless you use your head, you won't be able to do it.
Shake
Did that kid mature at all?
Gorky
Miss YUFFIE. We pray for your success!
Gorky
Oh, you there! How is Miss YUFFIE doing?
Gorky
Winning Miss YUFFIE's heart must mean you have tremendous skill.
Shake
Compared to me, all of you are nothin' but a buncha babies.
Chekhov
Managing that girl must be exceedingly rough on you.
Staniv
I would like to fight you, however the Five Sacred Gods can only compete with those from Wutai…
Shake
Sh…
Staniv
…
Chekhov
…
Gorky
…
Godo
…Hm. You can do it…
Godo
Go! Fight till the end! But come back!
Mat-…
Take care of the Materia!!

I mean, please look after YUFFIE…!

Let's move on
Phew…
Yeah, let's get some rest
I'm all right
Well…
I could take a short nap
No time to waste
Phew, perfect. Now the Materia is back in its rightful place.
Hey…the order is all messed up.
Hey, what is this? The order of it's all messed up!
What the hell's goin' on!? The order of the Materia's all messed up!
Huh? Oh, it'll be all right…
Don't be so picky!
Anyways, that sure was close.
No, normally I would kick their butts, Boom, Bang!!
That Corneo guy's a real pain.
I'd rather deal with my dad than with that guy.
You know, some of those Turk guys are pretty good, huh?
At least, after all that, we got the Materia back.
Now come on everybody, let's continue our journey…
Hey!! W…Wait!
Oh, all right. Here, I'll give this to you guys.
…No, forget it. Besides, they have lots of Materia anyway.
Here, look, look!

Weapon seller
Huh? Oh another customer. You sure picked an out of the way place but…
But if it's the 'Keystone' you're looking for, you're too late. Don't have it.
Keystone?
What? You didn't come here for that?
The 'Keystone' is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere.  “You're not going to believe your ears,
but I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!
The Temple of the Ancients?
Ha, hah, hah, hah…
Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!
Huh? What?
Where is the Temple?
Let's change the subject
Never mind
I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really want to sell it but…
That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not be a good idea NOT to sell it to him…
Who did you sell it to?
The manager of the Gold Saucer. think his name was 'Dio'. Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here.
Come on…it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure would be something, huh?
Now that you mention it, I've heard of something called Ultimate Destruction Magic It's supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the Ancients.
Ultimate Destruction Magic…?
Come on! I said don't take it seriously!
Hey, don't just come bargin' in here!
You again? All right, what is it?
Huh? What? If it's the Keystone you want I already sold it!
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials…
Hey you wouldn't happen to have any Mythril on you, would you? I'll trade you something good if you could spare some.
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials…
Give him some
Forget it
Hey thanks! All right you can help yourself to either a big or small box.
Yeah? Well, guess that's that.

I got it from the guy in a little shack south of here, past the 'River'.
Dio
If you want to know more, go there and talk to him.
Can you let me borrow this?
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.
Dio
Hmm.
Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition.
One condition?
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!
What do I gotta do?
Not in the mood.
Dio
Hoo boy!
Dio
I see… Then let's pretend that this never happened.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh! So! You want the Keystone, right? How 'bout entertaining me first?
What do I gotta do?
Not in the mood.

Staff
Excuse me, sir.
Staff
I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now.
…So?
Staff
I'm really sorry!
Staff
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired.
What's wrong?
Too bad. It happens, though.
I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go talk to them.
Staff
I will let you know once the repairs are completed.
Are you thinking of just us going back?
Hey, CLOUD, Are we going back without the others?
Are we leaving the others?
CLOUD! Are we just going to leave the others?
We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?
CLOUD, how 'bout it? Can you tell me what's happened so far?
I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning.
Yeah! I'm for that!
Good idea.
I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.
CLOUD, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!
I'm tired…
All right, I'll give it a shot…
All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about?
Phew…
We are going after Sephiroth.
Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land.
The Promised Land?
A land full of Mako energy. …Or at least that's what the Shinra believe.
I don't know if it actually exists.
The Cetras will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.
Cetra? That some kinda disease?
That's what the Ancients call themselves.
Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?
…You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.
You search and travel, until you feel it. Then you just know that you've found it.
AERIS…can you feel it too?
I think so.
So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?
He's searching for that, and one other thing.
The Black Materia?
I heard from Dio that a man in a black cape was lookin' for the Black Materia.
I've never heard of Black Materia…
How many men with black capes and number tattoos are there?
…You know, of course, my tattoo is number 13.
How did you get that tattoo?
…Hojo put it on me. The rest are just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo.
So there are at least 13!?
You know…
I think Hojo did something to those men in the black capes.
But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though…
That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.
Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'.
And…
I'm sorry, forget it!
I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.
What was that, all of a sudden!?
What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed!
Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!
CLOUD…
I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?
I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?
But…
Be strong.
But, I…
Stop it, RED XIII! Be strong!
TIFA?
You're not the only one who's worried!
I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation…
Hey CID, let's go back to our rooms.
…zzzz…zzzz…
CLOUD…
What's wrong?
……
I thought about what I was going to say, but, it's kinda embarrassing…
Hey, CLOUD! Why don't the two of us sneak out of here and spend some time together?
Come on, let's go!
Hey.
Hee, hee!
Let's go on a date!

A D-A-T-E! Or haven't you ever gone on one?
Don't take me for a fool
Well, not a real one…
Hey…a little touchy, aren't we?
No, just a mixed-up kid…
Oh well. Come on, let's go!
Yo, CLOUD. You still up?

Ok, I'm going to just go ahead and say it…

AERIS would be able to just come out and say it, probably.
Huh?
Sometimes being old friends is hard.
I mean, timing is everything.
Yeah…
CLOUD…?
I…
…. ….
…Beautiful, isn't it?
……first off, it bothered me how you looked exactly alike.
Two completely different people, but look exactly the same.
The way you walk, gesture…
I think I must have seen him again, in you…
But you're different.
Things are different…
CLOUD…
I'm searching for you.
…?
I want to meet you.
But I'm right here.
I know, I know…what I mean is…
I want to meet…you.
Hey spike-head. What'd you wanna see fireworks with me for?
Not having fun?
You should've asked one of them!
Which would you have asked?
Oh man, there just ain't no choice!
TIFA, AERIS.
Ah, YUFFIE?
(hoo boy)
What the hell's that supposed to mean?
Hey, you don't mean…Marlene?
NO WAY! Forget it!
There ain't no way I'm lettin' a wacko like you anywhere near my little Marlene!
She's my baby. My prized possession.
…Marlene.
Wish I could've brought Marlene here. She'd love the fireworks.
Why the hell do I gotta be here with a jackass like you!
…The more I think bout it the madder I get!
Damn fireworks anyways.
Shut up!!
CLOUD…?
No I, uh…
…
I just felt like doing that.
That's all.
H, hey!! Say something, why don't you!

Say something, PLEASE!

There's no time for this! We have to go after CAIT SITH.

Don't you like being with me?
No, I don't
That's not it
Oh, don't tease me like that!
I'm glad.
Next time we come, let's take our time and go on more rides.
Oh, look at the time. We'd better get going.
Oh man I'm beat. Let's head back.
I should sleep really well tonight.
Thanks… for coming with me.
Yeah.
You wanna go back, CLOUD?
Hey? What's CAIT SITH doing?
That's…CAIT SITH. He's acting strange.

Come on now‚no running.
Hey! Look here! The Key Materia!
Tseng
Well done.
Hey!
W, w, wait a second. I won't run or hide.
Yes‚I was a spy. I was hired by the Shinra.
Don't mess with us!
…I trusted you. I can't believe you!
BARRET
Ya dirty &*$*%$!
You think this's a big joke!?
I can't help it. What's done is done. That's just the way it is.
How 'bout if we go on like nothing ever happened?
You're pushin' it‚CAIT SITH! You gotta lot of nerve staying with us all the while being a spy!
Then‚what are you goin' to do? Destroy me?
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.
So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
Who the hell are ya!? What's your real name!?
Part of the Shinra! Who the *&$# are you!?
Whoa‚I can't tell you my name.
We're not gettin' anywhere.
Right? I told you! Talking won't do any good‚so can't we just continue our journey?
…Alright‚yes‚I am a Shinra employee.
But we're not completely enemies.
…Something bothers me. I think it's you're ways of living
You don't get paid You don't get praised. And yet you still risk your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me…
It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too good if things ended the way it is now.
You're lying again.
…And so on‚and so on…
Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
Sounds fishy---
He won't come clean. And he won't quit being a spy.
We can't go on with someone like that. Pull your head out!
…I thought so. It won't do any good talking to you.
So‚I've prepared myself in case something like this happened.
Why don't you listen to this.
Dad! TIFA!
Marlene!
Hey! That's Marlene!
Ma…Marlene!?
…Marlene?
Marlene
Hey! It's dad! Dad! It's me‚Marlene!
Marlene
Hey! It's TIFA! TIFA! You know what!
Marlene
Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady…
Marlene
Hey! It's CLOUD!
…So‚there's no other way but to listen to me.
You're the lowest…
I didn't want to do this either. Not by using dirty tricks and taking hostages…
So‚this is how it is. There's no room for compromises. So why don't we go on as we did.
Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients‚right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.
Of course we'll get there after the Shinra‚ but you'll have to deal with that.
…Well‚we're stuck… We'll have to do what he says.
…Marlene.
I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to Mom?
Sorry‚CLOUD.
Uh‚yup.

Ya dirty &*$*%$!
You think I'm jokin'!?
I couldn't help it.
How 'bout if we go on like nothing ever happened?
No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but being a spy!
Then, what are you goin' to do? Kill me?
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.
So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!

You're lying again.
…And so on, and so on…
Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
Sounds fishy…
He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy.
We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon get real!!
…just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference.
But I prepared something in case this happened.
Why don't you listen to this?
Papa! TIFA!

But this is how it is…no compromises. So why don't we go on as we did?
Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients, right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.
Of course,we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to deal with that.
Oh, you didn't seem to know this, but…
The Keystone is the key to the Temple of the Ancients. Even so, you're all going, right?
I know where it is, so I'll show you later.
The Shinra have already been there, but I guess you have to deal with that.
…Well, we're stuck… We'll have to do what he says.
…Marlene.
I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to Mom?
Sorry, CLOUD.

Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.
They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.
Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.
Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.
Please, talk to me!

You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.

All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom…knowledge…
I will meld with it all. I will become one with it… it will become one with me.
Tseng
…You can do that?
Sephiroth
The way…lies here.
Sephiroth
Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.
For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, you will live again as a part of me.
Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw it.

I…I saw it.

Oh grossness!

Hey hey! Wh, what's the catch?

How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
Sephiroth
It's simple.
Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury.
Sephiroth
The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury.
Sephiroth
…What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet?
Think how much energy would be gathered!
Sephiroth
Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me.
All that boundless energy will be mine.
Sephiroth
By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence.
Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now…
Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?
Injure…the Planet?
Sephiroth
Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic…Meteor.
That'll never happen!
Wake up!!
Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
Wait, CLOUD!
Temple of the Ancients
CLOUD!!
Hey!! CLOUD!!
Hey, CLOUD!
CLOUD! What's wrong!
CLOUD! What are you doing?
CLOUD! What's wrong with you!?
What the hell is going on!
What are you doing?
Ha ha ha… Black Materia.
Ha ha ha… Call Meteor.
CLOUD!! Get a hold of yourself!
CLOUD…
I'm… CLOUD…
How should I?
…I remember! I remember my way.
…CLOUD.
Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?
…It's nothing so don't worry about it.
It's nothing.”
Sephiroth got away.
…Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.
So this must be Meteor, right?
Is it some sort of a disaster?
It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
Is something going to fall from the sky?
Something's going to fall down?
Oh, so something's going to fall from the sky?  It's going to be something big.
Something huge is falling from the sky?
I don't know what it is but…
It looks like it's going to make a mess…
I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?
Hmpf! It's not even an omen.
…This must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.
The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.
It finds small drifting planets with its magic.
And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely…
Sephiroth!?
Sephiroth
Ha ha ha… It is not me.
Sephiroth
During the time when the Ancients prospered there existed beings that grew up bathed in abundant Mako.
Sephiroth
They were pure creatures of natural shape. Several remain even now.
Sephiroth
These beings sealed their consciousness within materia, altering their lives for eternity.
The summon materia…
Sephiroth
Correct. Such a clever girl.
Sephiroth
The creatures that protect this temple have lived long, relics from the age of the Ancients.
Sephiroth
They belong to this planet even more than you do.
Sephiroth
Heh heh heh… Keep that in mind.
Any sign of Sephiroth?
He disappeared.
Received "Bahamut" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
We're locked in.
What is this?
…There's something written on it.
B.l.a.c.k…M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
Black Materia!!
Hey!
…Black Materia.
What should we do, CLOUD?
Shake it
Take it
Leave it
Wait a minute. I'll ask!
I don't understand…
What?
Really!?
They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.
If we could only move this, we could take the Black Materia.
But, the Temple would collapse.
Then just leave it.
If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?
Let's just leave it, OK?
That'll be safer. If no one else can take it…
Then Sephiroth can't either, right?
The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it.
I guess that means it's safe here.
Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!
Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?
No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.
Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.
It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia.
This place isn't safe.
So what are we going to do?
I heard your situation!
Hi, CLOUD. This is CAIT SITH.
I overheard the whole story!
Don't forget about me.
Everything you said makes perfect sense!
You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia. And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
So that means you don't trust me?
But CLOUD. There's really nothing else you can do.
Everyone, please trust me.
I guess we have no choice
No way
All righty then! Leave it all to me!
You sure are stubborn, CLOUD.
Everyone, hurry up and get outside!
I'll go with you to a safe place.
Please hurry, you've got to get out of here!
I'll be waiting at the exit!
Please believe me, CLOUD.
Hmmm, I guess I have to
How can I?
This must be it!
The Ancients sure did a great job making this.
I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed…
There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's only one me!
Don't forget me even if another CAIT SITH comes along.
Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet…
What do they mean?
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?
Then no one could take it.
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.
And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.
As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too. Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?
Yes, but there's one thing…
You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.
So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
I see… the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily…
Temple of the Ancients
I guess there's no way we can open it… We'll come back later.
It's warm…
This isn't good…
CLOUD… …behind you.
Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's Me!!
I'll handle the rest!
Well, everyone… Take care of yourselves!
CAIT SITH…
Come on, CLOUD… Say something.
I'm not good at this.
Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.
Why don't you read our fortunes?
Say, that's right… I haven't done it in a while, huh?
I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me
Now, what should I predict?
Hmm, let's see how compatible CLOUD and I are!
That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!
Here I go!
This isn't good. I can't say it.
Poor TIFA.
No! Tell me!
I promise I won't get mad!
Is that so? Then I'll tell you.
Looks good. You are perfect for each other!
AERIS's star and CLOUD's star! They show a great future!
CLOUD, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher… I'll do whatever you want me to!
You just call me when it all happens!
Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.
This is the final, final farewell!
Be strong CAIT SITH!!
She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.
Owwww…
What happened?
I can still move more.
The Ancients went out of their way to make this great machine.
I'm saving this Planet too! I'm a little embarrassed…
This must be it!
Temple of the Ancients
That's the Black Materia…
Hey! I'll keep watch here!
I'll wait here.
I'll be sittin' out here.
Heh heh…this looks majorly boring, so I'll stay here.
I'm gonna have a smoke out here!
Ahhh!! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this.
I'll be looking around here.
Got Key Item "Black Materia!"
As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.
Mmm?
Can you guys use it?
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.
You mean lots of spiritual energy?
That's right.
One person's power alone won't do it.
Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy…
Oh yeah!
The Promised Land!!
The Promised Land!!
No, but…
Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.
Sephiroth
…Ah, but I have.
Sephiroth
I'm far superior to the Ancients.
I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients.
I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients.
And soon, I will create the future.
I won't let you do it! The future is not just yours!
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…I wonder?
Sephiroth
Wake up!
Sh…shut up!
The…noise…
No!
Don't be afraid--!
Waaaa~!!
What are you doing!?
Sephiroth
There, CLOUD…good boy.
Wa…aaaa…aaa…
Gave "Black Materia" to Sephiroth!
Sephiroth
…Well done.
CLOUD, are you all right?
…I gave the Black Materia to Sephiroth?
Wha…what did I do? Tell me, AERIS.
CLOUD…be strong, OK?
Urrrrrrgh… What have I done!?
CLOUD… you haven't done anything.
It's not your fault.
I…I'm---!
CLOUD!!
CLOUD, what are you doing!?
Urrggggggh!!!! CLOUD!!
HEY! CLOUD, you #$#&@!
CLOUD!!
AERIS, are you all right!?
What!? CLOUD!
AERIS! CLOUD, what're you doing!?
…!!
CLOUD!
Hey, EY!!
CLOUD! What the hell are you doing!?
Oops! This looks like a bad time!
I'm CAIT SITH No. 2. Right pleased to meet you all!
Oops! This looks like a bad time!
I'm CAIT SITH No. 2. Pleased to meet you all!
CLOUD!! What are you doin'!!
Everything is white…
What did I do? I don't remember anything…
My memory…since when? If everything's a dream, don't wake me.
Temple of the Ancients
That's the Black Materia…
Hey! I'll keep watch here!
I'll wait here.
I'll be sittin' out here.
Heh heh…this looks majorly boring, so I'll stay here.

Oops! This looks like a bad time!

CLOUD!! What are you doin'!!
Everything is white…
What did I do? I don't remember anything…
My memory…since when? If everything's a dream, don't wake me.
CLOUD, can you hear me?
Yeah, I hear you. Sorry for what happened.
Don't worry about it.
…I can't help it…
Oh…
Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?
And let me handle Sephiroth.
And CLOUD, you take care of yourself.
So you don't have a breakdown, okay?
What is this place?
This forest leads to the City of the Ancients… and is called the Sleeping Forest.
It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.
That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.
The secret is just up here.
At least it should be. …I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.
Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over.
AERIS?
Sephiroth
Hmm… So she's going to interfere? She'll be a difficult one, don't you think?
Sephiroth
We must stop that girl soon.
…CLOUD.
[Empty Entry]
[Empty Entry]
You look like you was havin' a nightmare.
How are you feeling?
I seem to be OK
Not good
Don't really know
That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
Oh… Better keep it to yourself.
I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.
You know, CLOUD. AERIS is gone.
Everyone's out looking for AERIS.
…The City of the Ancients. AERIS is headed there.
By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?
Hey, we're goin' too.
Only the Ancients, only AERIS can save us from Meteor…
Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to AERIS? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
Sephiroth…already knows.
Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
Let's go, CLOUD.
No.
I might lose it again.
If Sephiroth comes near me I might…
Yeah, godammit! It's because of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
My fault?
I know you got problems… Hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.
But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
CLOUD, we came this far… Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
Goddamn jackass, that's what you are…
Just think about it… How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?
People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.
But, they go on living. They don't run away… That's just how it is.
CLOUD…you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
No…
I'm afraid. If this keeps up, I may go crazy!
I'm afraid…
What…am I supposed to do?
Just pull out of here?
To where?
Wait a minute, TIFA. give him a little time.
He has to decide this on his own.
CLOUD…
You believe in CLOUD… right?
You awake?
Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.
You sure do have good friends.
Hey, how are you?
CLOUD…
I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?
You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?
Either way, if you stay around here all you're gonna do is worry about it.
Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth… If it happens, it happens.
I'll go upside your spikey head and bring you back to normal!
CLOUD, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
But…
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
…You're…right. He's right, isn't he?
Come on, let's go and find AERIS.
…I'm afraid to find out the truth. But…why?
Welcome to Bone Village, a town for nature lovers.
What do you want?
Where is the City of the Ancients?
Do you know where AERIS is?
What are you doing?
What do you want?
Have you seen Sephiroth?
What are you doing?
Oh, the man in a black cape. He was looking for the Temple of the Ancients.
The Temple of the Ancients?
Thanks
It's way down south. It's on the other side of this town and the inland sea.
It's the pyramid rising out of the forest.
How do you get in?
That's enough
You'll need the Keystone.
What's a Keystone?
Oh, yeah, I know
Just like it sounds. A rock that's a key. I heard that some rich guy has it.
You need something?
Are you going to run away??
What are you doing?
Through fossils, we already know everything that happened on this Planet since the beginning.
Now, we want to see the rest on to the end of the Planet… It's a mixed feeling…
The City of the Ancients? Oh, you must mean the Forgotten City.
Are you talking about that girl? I warned her, but she went into the Sleeping Forest anyway.
Excavating is great. It's like a history of the Planet told in the land.
This town's motto is not to think about anything.
Just live. Eat, work, and sleep.
It's pretty hard not to think about anything.
Want to buy something?
Want to buy something?
I want the Lunar Harp
Don't want anything
Thanks! Now, the forest will awaken.
The Lunar Harp is somewhere in the ground here. We could excavate it for you if you want us to.
Start diggin'
I want to buy something
Not right now
Other than the Lunar Harp, What else do you want us to dig for?
Lunar Harp
Good treasure
Normal treasure
This has already been excavated.
All right! Then I'll lend you some of my staff. Show us where you want us to dig!
Everything already excavated is in the box next to the tent.
The memory of this planet is buried layer by layer in this geological stratum. Kind of romantic, don't you think?
The forest just beyond here is called the Sleeping Forest. Right now the forest is asleep. Anyone who wanders in while it's asleep, gets confused. You can go in, but you may never come out…
But just now, a girl in pink and a man in a black cape went in. You think they'll be all right?
You can awaken the Sleeping Forest if you have the Lunar Harp.
Once awake, they say the forest will open a road for you.
The girl in pink who just went in used a Lunar Harp to get through.
I want a Lunar Harp
Not interested
Ask the guy in the tent below.
We use the newest system to find buried treasure. We use bombs to make earthquakes, and then check the sound waves given off by the tremors.
Please push [SWITCH] to set staff in position.
Order a search (100 gil)
Done
Could not position the staff, due to a lack of funds.
Press [SWITCH] to ignite the bomb for the search.
The staff member will calculate the tremors and dig up the buried item.
The dig point is where the staff's line of vision meets.
Move to the dig point and press [SWITCH] to select. The staff will dig for the item.
Now, the staff will dig here. The result will be placed in the treasure box overnight.
Excavating is a slow process. The treasures we excavate are stored in the box next to the tent. Remember that.
It, it's scary…
Just a while ago, a young girl asked me the same things.
Then the entrance to the forest made a funny sound, like 'Grrrrrrgh!'.
I thought that maybe I could do it, too.
Please, let me in!
While ago, a man in black came and said this as he went into the forest.
Nnnnnnghaah!
The Sleeping Forest awoke…
This place…!
So that's……the capital of the Ancients The Forgotten City'.
AERIS is in that 'City'.
…Ugh.
…Words of the Ancients?
…No good. I can't understand.
…Ugh, again?
This stream of consciousness… Could this be the words of the Ancients…?
Eyaaaa!
…Consciousness of the Ancients?
…I'm sorry. …I can't…understand.
Eaayy!? Again?
It speaks directly to my mind… Is this the Consciousness of the Ancients?
Whoa…!
What the hell's this?
Hey Ancients, I don't even have a clue what you're trying to say to me.
Whoa, @#$%! Not again!
Who is it? Who's trying to peek into my mind?
Is it the Consciousness of the Ancients?
Hey, there's a bed.
Do you think the people who used to live here used it?
Look, there's a bed here.
Yeah, and it looks pretty comfortable.
How COOL! I can't believe we found such a soft bed in a dive like this.
We're in luck. There's a bed in here.
I wonder if the owners used this?
Yo, CLOUD. Let's take a break here.
Shall we take a break here?
Hey, let's rest a bit. I'm tired…
I'm beat. Why don't we get some rest?
Come on--, let's rest for a while--- I don't want to walk anymore…
Why don't we catch some ZZZs?…
Maybe we should take a short nap?
Here's a bed.
Get some rest?
Yes
No
I feel it…
AERIS is here. …and so is Sephiroth.
…It's not an excuse. I feel it in my soul.
CLOUD, what is it?
CLOUD…what's wrong?
What's wrong? Are you sick?
Do you know what TIME it is!?
Hey---, CLOUD. What's your problem?
What's wrong? What time is it…?
…What's wrong?
Wh, what! Sephiroth!?
You're saying it's not just AERIS, but Sephiroth, too?
What! Sephiroth's here too!?
Wa, wa, wait a minute. You serious!?
No way---! Sephiroth wasn't invited!
Are you serious, CLOUD!?
…If that's true, then we're in for it.
How do you know that?
But how can you tell?
How did you find out?
Hey, how do you know!?
Wh…why? How can you tell that kind of stuff?
But how can you tell that?
…How did you find that out?
Then, we better get up offa our lazy asses!!
If that's true, then we've got to hurry! We've got to get to AERIS!
Wh,…what should we do? We must hurry to her!
@#$$, CLOUD. We can't be sittin' around on our asses.
That means it's pretty bad …doesn't it?
If that's true, then we're in for it! We have to find AERIS fast!
If that's true, we should hurry. Something terrible could happen at any moment.
…Right. Let's hurry and find AERIS.
No time to be sleeping.
No time to think about it.
AERIS's voice…… Coming from there?
We have to find AERIS.
Hey yo! Wait up.
I hate to say it, but I'm beat. Isn't there anywhere to rest.
Hey, hey CLOUD.
I'm…I'm so tired. Can't we find somewhere to rest?
Wait!
I'm exhausted. Let me get some rest somewhere.
H…ey, CLOUD
I gotta get some more rest. Let me catch a snooze somewhere around here.
Ahhh--- I can't go another step!!
I'm so----o tired! If you don't get me to a bed, I'm not taking another step!
Wa------it!
I'm exhausted. I'm sorry, but please let me rest somewhere.
Wait, CLOUD.
…I'm tired.
That way goes to the Mountains up north. Let's hurry and find AERIS.
If we continue this way, we'll end up in the Northern Mountains. AERIS isn't over there, right?
That road leads to the Northern Mountains. We have to go the other way to find AERIS.
You thinkin' of going skiing? If we wanna find AERIS, we go THAT way!
We're looking for AERIS, right! Then why are you heading for the mountains!? What a dork!
CLOUD, uh that's the road to the Northern Mountains.
AERIS is waiting, let's go find her.
This is the road to the Northern Mountains. Don't you want to find AERIS?
AERIS?
CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD!
Stop it!!
Stop!
Please stop that!
What're you doing!
Sto----p!
Dumb #^%@!
Stop it!
Ugh…what are you making me do?
…stay…back…
…AERIS.
This can't be real!
Sephiroth
Do not worry. Soon the girl will become part of the Planet's energy.
All that is left is to go North. The 'Promised Land' waits for me over the snowy fields.
Sephiroth
There, I will become a new being by uniting with the Planet. As will this girl…
…Shut up.
The cycle of nature and your stupid plan don't mean a thing.
AERIS is gone.
AERIS will no longer talk, no longer laugh, cry…or get angry…
What about us…what are WE supposed to do?
What is this pain?
My fingers are tingling. My mouth is dry. My eyes are burning!
Sephiroth
What are you talking about? Are you trying to tell me you have feelings now?
Of course! What do you think I am!?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…… Stop acting as if you are sad.
And there's no need to act as if you're angry either.
Sephiroth
Because, CLOUD. You are…
Jenova
Because, you are…a puppet.
Jenova
You are…
I'm…a puppet?
Everyone‚listen to me.
I'm CLOUD‚ex-SOLDIER‚ born in Nibelheim.
I came to settle up with Sephiroth.
What're ya tryin' to say?
…What's going on?
…Hmm?
I heard that before.
Why now?
Why're you being so formal? Is something wrong?
…You're right.
I came here by my own free will… Or so I thought.
However…
…To tell the truth, I'm afraid of myself.
…There is a part of me that I don't understand.
That part that made me give the Black Materia to Sephiroth.
If you hadn't stopped me, AERIS might have been…
…There's something inside of me. A person who is not really me.
That's why I should quit this journey.
Before I do something terrible.
But I am going.
He destroyed my hometown five years ago, killed AERIS‚and is now trying to destroy the Planet. I'll never forgive…Sephiroth.
I… I must go on.
…I have a favor to ask of you.
Will you all come with me?
…to save me from doing something terrible.
…I dunno‚ man…
…But‚CLOUD
…All right‚CLOUD.
Well‚ we'll face it when it happens.
Leave it to me!
Watch you?…… We're all in this together!
…I guess so.
I don't know how AERIS tried to save the planet from the Meteor.
And I guess now, we'll never know.
But!
We still have a chance. We must get that Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses it.
Let's go.
Everyone, listen to me.
I am CLOUD, born in Nibelheim and formerly of SOLDIER.
I came here to settle up with Sephiroth.
…What's wrong?
…yeah, so?
…Huh?
What hit you so suddenly?
…Yes.
I've heard all this before.
I came here on my own will…… or at least that's what I thought. But…
To be honest… I'm afraid of myself.
There's a part of me I don't understand.
Like when I gave away the Black Materia.
And if you all hadn't stopped me, …AERIS might have…
…It's something inside me.
That is why, maybe I shouldn't go on with this journey.
I may do something terrible.
But, I AM going on.
Five years ago, he burned down my hometown, then he took AERIS.
And now he's trying to destroy the Planet. I won't let him get away with it.
…I must go on.
But…I have a favor to ask of you.”
…Will you all still go with me?
Please watch me so I don't do anything horrible.
…But, CLOUD.
…But, you know…
…All right, CLOUD.
All right, we'll watch you.
…I see.
Well, if somethin' happens, it happens.
I wonder how AERIS was going to save this planet from Meteor. We have no way of finding out now.
But…
We still have a chance. We need to get the Black Materia back before Sephiroth uses Meteor.

Which way'd that damn foo' Sephiroth go?
Sephiroth… I wonder which way he went?
Sephiroth… which way did he go?
…Which way did that creep Sephiroth go!?
Ummm… Which way did that Sephiroth guy go?
I wonder which way Sephiroth went?
Which way did Sephiroth head?
Hey, you alright?
CLOUD! Get a hold of yourself!!
You all right?
Ey, hey! You alright?
Wait! Get a hold of yourself!
CLOUD! Are you all right?
…you all right?
Sephiroth said to me… Head North…… ……past the Snow Fields……
…ugh.
Hmmm…
Icicle Inn
What's down there?
You mean Boss…Tseng? That wasn't us. Sephiroth did it.
I'm not lying… it was Sephiroth.
Oh, man…
Wa…wait! Get out of the way Stay put Elena
There they are, hurry!!
Elena
CLOUD…huff…wheeze.
I won't let you go any further!
Elena
It's a SE-CR-ET.
It really doesn't matter! You really got guts messin' my boss up like that!
Elena
No! Liar! Don't think you can fool me!
Elena
Don't try to act innocent. I'll never forget it!!
Elena
Looks like just talking won't do. You're going to have to feel some pain!
Elena
No, I can handle him! There's no way he can avoid my punch.
Elena
Eyaaaah!
Elena
Why? Why didn't you try to duck?
Elena
There's no way they can climb the Great Glacier anyway.
Put them in some house in the village.
Yes ma'am!!
Just you…and me!!
What?  Yeah…
This village is now under martial law!
(Do as you're told)
(Kick his butt)
Don't be angry. I'm just doing my job.
Stop it, there're kids around!
Listen, I probably shouldn't tell you, but I hear something big's going down up North.
The President's gonna be there. So, would you please just lay low for a while?
Ele…Elena!?
Who--a!!
No, don't!! There's a steep grade, past here.
It's dangerous, please don't go!
I'm still going
Thanks for your kindness
Damn, I was just being nice…
What the? Who are those people over there? Looks like trouble!
No, no. I just did what came natural.
I guess I'm not too busy now. Do you want to learn how to ride a snowboard?
Maybe I should
Not interested
Do you want me to explain again?
Yes, please
No thanks
You're so boring!
Sorry I ran off a while ago… I thought there was going to be trouble.
Anyhow, you'll need a snowboard to get down that hill. Want to learn how to ride one?
Yeah, maybe I should
No, not interested
All right, fat-head… But don't blame me if you get hurt.
What the? They sure were weak for Shinra.
I told you, you can't!
You won't make it without a snowboard and a map!!
Be careful!
There's a steep hill past here. You shouldn't go any further.
There's a barrier at the North end of the crater! You shouldn't go any further.
A bright light shattered the barrier at the crater! What in the world's goin' on!?
When I first moved here, I saw a man with a black cape heading North.
It seemed strange seeing the black cape in the snowy white.
Sledding's fun!
Who is that man?
I'm gonna try snowboarding after this!
Next time, I'm gonna make an even bigger one.
What's a barrier? You mean that light on the top of the mountain?
A sad voice is getting louder every second!
The mountain must be crying. Is it hurt?
It's almost finished!
I heard that there's a barrier on top of the mountain.
Once the barrier's gone, I can hear cries from beyond the mountain…
Dodge that punch!

I got hurt on my snowboard, and now I can't go out for a while…
Hey, I'll give you my snowboard.
…whimper…weep…
Tell me if you get good at it.
I wanted to get a lot better at snowboarding…
My boy got hurt right about the time we moved here…
I never shoulda got him that snowboard.
Teach me too, OK!?
I can't live in this town anymore. It gets so cold here!
I have to move again… I don't know where to start.
The reason for the drop in temperature must be because of that dome of light at the Northern limits…
You all should get away from here and go to a place like Mideel Island in the south.

The master is an experienced climber, you know.
I've heard that he knows every corner of that Great Glacier!
Grandma, don't sleep so close to the fire!
Grandma's been sick for a while and doesn't have much energy…
I just get SO comfortable.
My husband left 20 years ago and still hasn't come back.
He should at least be at the foot of Gaea's Cliff. It's marked with a check on the map…
…cough…cough… I've been living in this town for 60 years. And I STILL caught a cold…
I heard there's a doctor on a Southern island somewhere. I sure wish he'd come here…cough…cough…
It's nearly impossible to reach the Northern limits without a map.
If you're thinkin' 'bout going to the Northern limits, you'd better take that map on the wall.
What nerve! You already tore down the map.
I'm thinkin' 'bout taking that hill on my skis.
It's the first time that the temperature has dipped this low, this fast…
There's also that mysterious light at the Northern limits, too. Does this mean it's the end of the world?

I've heard there's a snow woman at the Great Glacier that hates hot springs…
But I think it's just a myth to scare off visitors.
Do you know what a Cetra is?
Yeah, a Cetra lived in this town a long time ago.
Her name was Ifalna, and she knew about a lot of things…
I heard she was abducted by the Shinra and was taken somewhere.
With all the strange things happening in the world, I kinda understand why people want to leave…
What were the Cetra? Oh yeah, they were the same as the Ancients, right?
Whadaya mean?
Shinra and the Ancients… I smell somethin' fishy…
Maybe we'd better leave town soon too.
Let's go to that island in the South! What was it called?
Yeah, yeah, I heard that there's a town called Mideel on a southern island.
I heard some guy went to the Great Glacier in the North.
What an idiot. Is he thinkin' 'bout going to that hot spring?
He's probably gonna get lost in the glacier and freeze to death.
No matter how well equipped he is, out there in that cold on the glacier, I give him two days at the most.
You thinkin' of going North?
That's my plan
No
Well…if you're going past this town you'll need a map.
Maybe there's one left at Mr. Holzoff's house. He used to be a mountain climber.
Yeah, we really don't have anything here, but make yourself at home.
If you go further North, I heard there's a Huge Crater.
Something huge must've fallen from the sky a long time ago!
Am I boring you?
Welcome! You look like a STRONG one…
If you want, I could lend you an ear?
Yeah
Not interested
What's with you!? You make me sick!
I got bored listening to his stories.

Then, Ifalna, please tell us about the Cetra.
Tell us, Ifalna… Where is the land called 'Knowlespole'?
Ifalna, what exactly does Planet-reading entail?
Do the Ancients, rather, the Cetra, have special powers to heal the Planet?
Hmm, even here so close to the North Cave, the snow never melts. Is that because the Planet's energy is gathered here to heal its injury?
Ifalna… Let's take a break.
Who is the person that appeared at the North Cave? I haven't any idea.
You don't look well… Let's call it a day.
Camera's ready!
2000 years ago, our ancestors, the Cetra, heard the cries of the Planet.
The first ones to discover the Planet's wound were the Cetra at the Knowlespole.
Knowlespole refers to this area. The Cetra then began a Planet-reading.
…I can't explain it very well, but it's like having a conversation with the Planet…
It said something fell from the sky making a large wound.
Thousands of Cetra pulled together, trying to heal the Planet…
But, due to the severity of the wound, it was only able to heal itself over many years.
No, it's not that kind of power. The life force of all living things on this Planet becomes the energy.
The Cetra tried desperately to cultivate the land so as not to diminish the needed energy…
Yes, the energy that was needed to heal the Planet withered away the land…then the Planet…
The Planet tried to persuade the Cetra to leave the Knowlespole, but…
I'm all right… When the Cetra…were preparing to part with the land they loved…
That's when the one who injured the Planet… or the 'crisis from the sky', as we call it, came.
The Cetra were attacked by the virus and went mad… transforming into monsters.
That's when it appeared!
It looked like…our…our dead mothers …and our dead brothers. Showing us specters of their past.
It first approached as a friend, deceived them, and finally… gave them the virus.
Then, just as it had at the Knowlespole.
It approached other Cetra clans… and infected them with…the virus.
Ifalna, can you comment on the thing called 'Weapon'?
Back then, Weapon was a weapon the Planet produced by its own will?
So, Weapon no longer exists on this Planet?
Where is Weapon?
…Thank you, Ifalna, that will be all for today…
Yes, Professor.
Yes, but… There is no record of Weapon ever being used.
A small number of the surviving Cetra defeated Jenova and confined it.
The Planet produced Weapon… But it was no longer necessary to use it.
Weapon cannot vanish. …It remains asleep somewhere on the Planet.
I don't know… I can't hear the voice of the Planet well…
Times…have changed. The Planet…is probably watching this situation closely.
The one the Professor mistook for a Cetra…was named Jenova. That is the 'crisis from the sky'.
The Planet knew it had to destroy the 'crisis from the sky'…
You see, as long as Jenova exists, the Planet will never be able to fully heal itself.
Even though Jenova is confined, it could come back to life at some time…
The Planet has not fully healed itself yet. It's keeping watch on Jenova.
… Please don't say it that way.
It's our lovely daughter, both yours…and mine!
Don't you want to capture her childhood on videotape?
Never say that! I will protect you and AERIS no matter what!!
You and AERIS are my only treasures. I'll never let you go!!
Who could that-? I was just about to…
Damn!!
How dare they intrude on our 'private time' together!
Hojo… How did you know?
A new sample? You don't mean AERIS!?
That's it! I'm severing all ties with the Shinra.
Hojo, please leave.
Ifalna!
Don't worry, Ifalna. I'll take care of this!
Ifalna! Take AERIS and run!!
Video again? You just got through taping!
If you keep doting on her like that, she won't grow up to be strong…
AERIS is different from the other children. I wonder what dangers await her…?
I feel so much better now, darling.
If I hadn't met you, I…
I'll send them away.
Yes, at once!!
Who the devil?
It, it's them!!
Please, AERIS has nothing to do with it! All you want is me, right?
Eyaaaaaah… Darling…!!
Heh, heh, heh I've been searching for you, Ifalna… or should I say, Cetra!
Long time no see, Professor Gast!
Believe me, I had to turn over a stone or two to find you.
Two years I waited… That's how much I wanted this new sample. Ha, ha, ha.
Hmm, AERIS? What a nice name. Ha, ha, ha.
I'll need all of you for my experiment.
You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!
Please don't put up a fight. I don't want any harm to come to my precious sample.
Mmm? What a funny looking camera. Guard! Destroy it!
Be careful with her!! Ha, ha, ha…
Wh…what are you doing, Professor!?
Oh, and uh… don't forget the child!
Hmm, a video? The Ancients…Weapon!?
Heh, heh, heh…a mountain of treasure! Thank you Professor…Ha, ha, ha
You understand don't you, Professor Gast? We can change the future of the Planet!
Oh, I'm thinking of taping it on video.  But, the video's not working right…
No, that's not it. I'm going to record my beautiful daughter.
I've already decided! If it's a girl, then it'll be AERIS. That's that!
Right!? Oh, the video tape…
And when she's sleeping, her face …looks like an angel.
What are you doing, Profes-- I mean, honey?
What are you going to tape? Is there still something I haven't mentioned?
First, we have to figure out her name. We can take the video later!
You are SO selfish! But AERIS is a good name!
Hee hee…it's a good name, considering it came out of that forgetful head of yours!
Received "Turbo Ether"!
Ugh…
I guess we're still in one piece.
Everyone all right?
Yeah, I guess.
Of course.
I'm sick of this.
…Snow in my ear.
God! I can't stand it!
I'm a little off.
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm too old for this! Damn!
So where did we land?
That didn't seem like such a big jump…
In fact, it feels like we didn't even jump at all…
We've jumped pretty far…
We've jumped pretty far…
Well, we've got a map, right? Look at the map by pressing [SWITCH].
Hey. Let's take a look at the map. Press [SWITCH].
We need the map, okay!? Let's see it with [SWITCH].
Hey, what's that!? You just got something, right? Use [SWITCH] to see it.
All right, let's look at the map. We use [SWITCH], right?
Then, let's look at the map. Just push [SWITCH].
We should check it on the map. Press the [SWITCH].
Quick! The map, the map! Look at it with [SWITCH]!
It sure is cold. We'll freeze if we stay here any longer.
This is the only place not frozen.
Touch it
Let's go on
Hmm, a hot springs.
…go.
Don't worry about me.
Now, I don't want to hurt any of you.
And don't come back again.
Please, stop it.
Please, that's enough.
Yeeew… You got a lot of nerve trying to touch me with the same dirty hands that touched that filthy hot spring!
I'll never forgive you.
Hah, just remember your place!
Still don't get it, eh?
Why this?

Now, this is a surprise!!
It's been years since I last saw anyone up here.
Oh, I'm sorry, my name is Holzoff. I've lived here for 20 years.
Do you mind hearing some stories from a lonely climber?
Why don't we go to the next room and sit down.
To climb this cliff, you must check your route
…And you have to keep your body temperature normal. Don't forget these 2 things.
Like to rest a little?
Oh yeah
No, thanks
Don't overdo it.
You awake?
You collapsed at the Great Glacier. It's a miracle you're alive.
My name is Holzoff. I've been living here 20 years now.
If you are planning to head north, you'd better listen to me.
It's dangerous past the cliff because of the Barrier!
It's better not to go anywhere near it!!
You shouldn't go near the cliff unprepared, it's dangerous!!
[OK]Confirm route.
[SWITCH]Push repeatedly to raise body temperature.
Base of Gaea's Cliff
Holzoff
You ever hear about those who challenged the cliff?
Yeah
No
The first time my friend Yamski and I tried to climb the cliff was 30 years ago.
There's an old legend that says something fell from the sky here a long time ago.
It's supposed to have pushed the land up and formed this cliff.
20 Years ago, Yamski and I braved this cliff to see what was on the other side.
But, we weren't prepared for it. We never dreamed the temperature would be so low…
That cliff has a biting cold wind that lowers your body temperature.
Yamski was below me. He cut his own rope…
…I didn't even notice…
I've lived here ever since… challenging the cliff and providing warning and shelter to my fellow climbers.
If you're going to climb the cliff, you need to take 2 precautions.
First, check your route… It's hard to find because of all the snow.
Second, warm yourselves up once you get to a ledge.
Understand?
One more time
Yes
You must be tired coming all the way up here… Better get some rest before you head out.
Want to get some rest?
Rest
Don't rest
[OK]Confirm route.
[SWITCH]Push repeatedly to raise body temperature.
Base of Gaea's Cliff
We'll secure the route. You come up later.
You know, I've been thinkin'…
What is it?
Save it for later
…Seein' a place like this, makes you realize how awesome nature is.
But, if anyone ever told me to live here, I'd tell them to…well, you know…
I tell you one thing though, If I did have to live here I'd change things around 'n' make it better.
I guess Midgar is the total opposite of this place.
When you think of it that way, the Shinra don't seem so bad…
Uuuuuurrrrrgh!!
What the hell am I sayin'!? The Shinra, not bad!?
Y'know…standing here like this…
Kinda makes you feel like the Planet's not really with us, y'know?
Of course we can't even compete. I mean… The Planet don't even notice us humans…
Gotta keep telling myself this blizzard's okay…brr
I wonder what's at the top of that cliff? Well we shall see…
Brrrr, I can't take this cold!!
Damn! If I was back in the air, this cliff would be nothing!
I wonder what's on the other side of that cliff…
This is secret info, but… Rufus's going to arrive here, too.
Look we can't go to the cliff! So just give it up!!

An old crater…
Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here…
Leaving a scar on the Planet.
Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor.
Next time the wound won't be so small.
So all this energy's gathered here for the Planet to heal itself?
So the Planet has gathered all this energy here to heal itself?
The energy of the Planet is concentrated here.
It is slowly healing its old wound.
Even I know what's going on. The energy's bein' gathered here to heal the gash.
Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered all that energy to try an' heal itself.
It's trying to heal its wound by gathering all that energy here.
It's amassed a vast amount of energy to heal itself.

I feel something…danger?
Hey, hey,! What's goin' on?
I was just getting into it!
Vanished? That can't be!
Stay on alert. You never know when Sephiroth might appear.
What I wanted was a body. A seeing, hearing, moving body. Soon it will be…over.
Hmph… Heh, heh…
You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness.

Hey…guys!
Where are we? Where did we end up?
TIFA!!
Something's weird here! It got pitch black all of a sudden, and everyone disappeared!
Yea…yeah!
I don't know what's goin' on, but let's just get on with it.

Please come. Help us!

…hee hee hee… And remember… …the Black Materia!
BARRET, you're here! I'm so glad!!
RED XIII, you're here! I'm so glad!!
I wonder how CLOUD and the others are?
It's hard to believe… such a small piece of Materia could destroy the Planet.
What the!?
Is everyone all right?
What's going on?
Everyone!!
Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!

I'm not sure I understand… but I'll go if you want me to.

Jenova's cells…
…hmm. So that's what this is all about.
The Jenova Reunion…
I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about is beating Sephiroth.
He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here.
It's both incredibly wicked and cruel…
But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within the Planet's wound.
…The Black Materia is back in our hands.
Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the end of it.
I'm going to face Sephiroth.
Sephiroth is inside.
Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you.
Hold on to this… I don't trust myself.
I don't think I can…
We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch.
Sephiroth… What a damn crazy #*&^%.
Give the Black Materia to...
Give to BARRET
Don't Give to BARRET
Damn! The pressure's on now.
Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?
But Sephiroth is…
We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't you give it to someone else to hold on to?
Let's find Sephiroth!!
What's happening, CLOUD? That wasn't Sephiroth!
CLOUD, be careful!
Give the Black Materia to...
Give to RED XIII.
Don't give to RED XIII.
You want me to take the Black Materia? All right, I understand.
Hoo-boy…
Let me catch some shut-eye.
Me and Black Materia just don't mix.
What!? You mean that wasn't Sephiroth? All that time I was following this …thing?
Shouldn't we hurry? The real Sephiroth is still close, right?
I don't want anything to do with that Black Materia!
You serious!? That's not Sephiroth!
Something feels rea---lly weird here!
No, not the Black Materia, please.
So it wasn't Sephiroth…?
You never know when Sephiroth may show up… so don't let your guard down.
How about if you hold on to the Black Materia?
You mean… we weren't in pursuit of Sephiroth?
Whirlwind Maze
Hmm…I see,
Guess I shouldn't have worried about it.
TIFA, you'll be alright now.
Yeah, sorry I made you worry. I solved the mystery.
I'll explain it to you later. I need to do something now.
Sure, OK.
I think I overdid it a little, too.
Really?
What…do you mean?
Nibelheim…
Why Nibelheim!? Are you high on Mako or something?
But, how!? A dream?  An illusion?
But TIFA! Isn't this an illusion?
But why Nibelheim? This is freaky, REALLY freaky!
Why, is it an illusion?
What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?
This is an illusion Sephiroth made up.
He's trying to confuse us.
It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Come on, let's keep going.
Yeah, you're right…
Look!!
That ain't CLOUD… The hell is he?
CLOUD's not here… I wonder who…this is?
CLOUD, something's strange here. Who is this guy?
Huh---? CLOUD's not here.
That's not CLOUD. Who is this man?
CLOUD's not here…
Stop…Sephiroth.
This is so stupid…
How the hell're we gonna get outta here?
Is this illusion going to continue forever? How do we get out of it?
Come on, we have to hurry back to the real world!
I don't want to be in an illusion. Let's get back to the real world!
Now, how can we get out of here?
Hey, CLOUD. Let's get back to the real world, OK?
CLOUD… It's just an illusion.
Don't worry about it…
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
What is this? What happened?
Calm down, TIFA.
Sephiroth is near. Anything could happen.
Nibelheim
Hey, you alright!?
Damn! This was an illusion.
You all right!?
We were in an illusion…
Everyone OK!?
Umm…this was a hallucination.
He…hey, you! You alright!?
Oh, a dream! But it felt so real…
Are you all right?
Hmm…it was an illusion.
He…hey you! You alright!?
Damn! This was all made up.
Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!
That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago.
That's it, isn't it?
Sephiroth
I see you finally understand.
What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, right?
But…even making me see those things won't affect me.
I remember it all. The heat of the fire…the pain in my body…and in my heart!
Sephiroth
Oh, is that so?
You are just a puppet… You have no heart…and cannot feel any pain…
How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?
What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is the illusion.
Sephiroth
…Do you understand?
I don't want to understand.
But, I want to ask you one thing. Why…why are you doing this?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…
I want to take you back to your real self.
The one who gave me the Black Materia that day…
Sephiroth
Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful?
Hojo would die if he knew.
Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?
Sephiroth
Five years ago you were…
…constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt.
A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of the Mako.
An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. …That is your reality.
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…
CLOUD… Don't listen to him…
Cover your ears! Close your eyes!
All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie.
Don't we have our memories together?
Being kids together, starlit nights…
What's wrong, TIFA? I'm not affected by it.
…I wasn't paying attention to him.
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…TIFA…
Why are you so worried and scared by those words?
Hmm…Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha… You don't look well.
…TIFA? Is Sephiroth right?
CLOUD…
What's wrong, TIFA?
Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right.
No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that Sephiroth says.
It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am.
There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories.
But, TIFA…
You said, 'Long time no see, CLOUD' right?
Those words will always support me.
I am the one you grew up with. I'm CLOUD of Nibelheim.
No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth.
That's why you shouldn't be so scared.
No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your opinion that counts…
No, that's not true, CLOUD…
What's not? I'm the same CLOUD you grew up with, aren't I?
That's not what I mean… I don't know how to say it…
CLOUD, I need some time… Just give me a little time…
Sephiroth
CLOUD… Don't blame TIFA.
I'll explain.
Sephiroth
The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the power of Jenova.
Inside of you, Jenova has merged with TIFA's memories, creating you.
Sephiroth
Out of TIFA's memory…
Sephiroth
A boy named CLOUD might've just been a part of them.
CLOUD…
Please…don't think right now.
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha… Think, CLOUD!
…CLOUD? Ha, ha, ha…Oh, excuse me. You never had a name…
Shut up…Sephiroth.
Sephiroth
You still don't understand? Then…
Sephiroth
Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for Mt. Nibel?
Sephiroth
…TIFA, you remember, right?
Sephiroth
But there is no way he would know.
Sephiroth
Now…what happened to that picture?
Sephiroth
…Is this it?
Sephiroth
…Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good.
CLOUD…Don't…
I…should be in the picture.
Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory world Sephiroth made up.
It's a photograph.
…Just as I thought.
This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory.
…Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the reactor. I was sixteen.
The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do? Oh yeah…
…SOLDIER, First Class?
…SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER?
Stop, CLOUD!!
How did I join SOLDIER?
Why…why can't I remember?
I'm…I'm…
That's right…
…I didn't have to worry about it, because I was…
…CLOUD?
Let's go, TIFA. I'm…I'm all right.
I saw my mom. I saw the people in town.
Yeah, I went to TIFA's room. There, I…
I played the piano!
I looked in the drawers!
I read the letter addressed to TIFA!
I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was excited about it.
Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in SOLDIER.
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
He---y! Is anyone here?
Give me a hand!
Zangan
Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?
Zangan
Then come over here and help me!
Zangan
I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
Zangan
Hey! What about the other houses?
…Sephi…roth
…Hey, ummm… Am I going to die?
Terrible…
Sephiroth… This is too terrible…
What's…next?
Stop it already!!
This is bad… Just like Corel.
This is terrible… Did Sephiroth do this?
This is insane…
Wow… I didn't know it was THIS bad…
All this happened while I slept?
This is terrible…
…This is what actually happened five years ago.
But…
It's probably not me that will come out of the Shinra mansion.
He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion.
See…didn't I tell you?
I don't want to…watch this. CLOUD…Don't watch.
…What's wrong, TIFA? I told you before, right?
As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need to be scared.
Inside Northern Cave
Scarlet
Wow!! That's amazing!
Scarlet
It's all Materia!!
Rufus
The outside is rich with Mako energy. The inside is a treasure trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land.
Hojo
There is no such thing as the Promised Land. It's a legend…an old wives tale… …It's utterly ridiculous.
Rufus
Everything's as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?
It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate scientist.
Rufus
What's happening?
Scarlet
It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's moving!
Hojo
Weapon…
Hojo
Then it really does exist… I didn't believe in it.
Rufus
What does this mean?
Hojo
…Weapon. A monster created by the Planet.
They appear when the Planet's in danger and destroy everything.
That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report.
Rufus
I never saw that report… Where is it?
Hojo
Here, right here.
Rufus
You keep a lot of things to yourself.
Scarlet
Mr. President… I've got a bad feeling about this place…
Rufus
Hmm…maybe we should go back to our ship now. We need to prepare for the inspection anyway.
Scarlet
Hey!!! Where did you come from?
…Don't know…
This place is going to get rough.
Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still can!!
Rufus
Leave things to you? Hmph…I don't know what you mean.
This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins and ends.
CLOUD?
Hey! We're here to help you!
I'm here! I'm here to help you, CLOUD!
Thanks…BARRET. Where's the Black Materia?
Thanks…RED XIII. Where's the Black Materia?
It's safe. I have it.
It's safe. I'm holding on to it.
I'll take it from here. Give me the…Black Materia.
You alright?
Are you all right, CLOUD?
Okay then, here. Had a lot of pressure holding this thing.
Then…here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this thing.
Thanks. Leave the rest to me.
Sorry to make you worry, but I'm all right now.
I'll make sure that the Black Materia is delivered.
CLOUD!!
Come on. The Black Materia…
Please wait! Just a little longer!!
Everyone, thanks for everything. And…I'm sorry.
…Sorry.
…Sorry.
Especially you, TIFA. I'm really sorry.
You've been so good to me… I don't know what to say…
I never lived up to being 'CLOUD'.
TIFA… Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'CLOUD'.
Professor Hojo…
Hojo
Ha,ha,ha… this is perfect!!!
It means that my experiment was a complete success.
Hojo
What number were you? Huh?  Where is your tattoo?
Professor Hojo… I don't have a number.
You didn't give me one because you said I was a failed experiment.
Hojo
What?
Hojo
What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
I didn't know the 'Reunion' already started.
But, here I am. And I brought the Black Materia with me Just as Sephiroth wanted.
Hojo
Shut up, miserable failure…
Professor…please give me a number. Please, Professor…
Won't you give me one? …Professor?
Hojo
I never dreamed what I thought was a success…was actually a failure, and that which I considered a failure was my greatest success…
Rufus
What are you guys talking about?
You can't hear my voice?
No, don't!!! Please! Stop CLOUD!
CLOUD!!
Hojo
Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!
Hojo
This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's  will!
They won't be diffused into the Lifestream, but gathered here!
Mwa, haa, ha…
What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you?
CLOUD has the Black Materia!
Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!
Rufus
Whatever I say now is too little… too late. We must evacuate.
Rufus
I want you all to come with me. There's still much more I want to know.
Yo!   CLOUD! Stop! Don't do it!
CLOUD, NO! Stop!  Please!
CLOUD!!
Rufus
Who…was that?
Hojo
…He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago.
Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life.
Hojo
…I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.
Hojo
You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.
Hojo
I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the clones have begun to return.
Hojo
I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.
But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.
Hojo
But being the genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.
Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream. He wants to manipulate the Clones himself.
Yes, that was how it got started.
Hojo
I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to figure it out.
I couldn't figure it out either.
Hojo
The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.
I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth.
I was being summoned by Sephiroth.
All the anger and hatred I bore him, made it impossible for me to ever forget him. That and what he gave me.
Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I brought you the Black Materia.
Show yourself to me. Where are you?
Sephiroth… So we finally meet again.
Great Cave
North Cave 5 -3
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
I didn't know what to do. I was always like that…
What's the matter?
ohhh…
…poor kid.
Ooouugh…
oo…uh…agh
Are you all right?
Uh…uh…TIFA?
TIFA?
TIFA!
…?
Oh, CLOUD!
That's right. I'm CLOUD.
Is it really you, CLOUD? I never thought I'd find you here!
Yeah, it's been a while.
What happened to you? You don't look well.
Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay.
How long has it been?
Five years.
…
What is it?
…it's really been a long time.
Actually, it's been seven years.
You joined SOLDIER but quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a mercenary…
You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim… 
But…
…Something was wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about.
All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did.
I wanted to make sure…
But then I heard…you were going far away…
And I didn't want that…
…I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.
And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to be with you and watch you.
…ding…
Huh?
The glare…
You'll be okay soon. You've been asleep a long time.
I'm…hungry…
About him?
…I'm scared.
Don't worry. I don't know what happened to CLOUD either.
Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry…
They don't know if he's alright either.
Is he still…alive?
How long…was I asleep?
Let's see now… Must've been about 7 days.
What about Sephiroth?
It ain't over yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave?
Well now the crater's surrounded by a huge light barrier.
Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in there protected by the barrier.
We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.
On top of that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on the rampage.
…Weapon?
Remember that huge monster with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater?
Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past.
Weapon…is protecting Sephiroth?
Dunno. But he's been goin' around tearin' stuff up.
Right now that Rufus is fightin' it. I hate to admit it, but he's got guts.
We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but there ain't no time…
Time…
… Hey! How about Meteor?
Do we have to give up?
…Dunno.
Rufus
I thought CLOUD would show up to save you all…
Professor Hojo wanted to check up on CLOUD, too.
What are you going to do to CLOUD?
Rufus
Sephiroth's alter ego…
Rufus
Meteor has been summoned… Essentially, it's all but over now.
Rufus
So, there's no need for you now.
Rufus
No, maybe there is an important task for you…
Heidegger
President! Preparations for the public execution are complete.
Execution!?
Rufus
You are to be executed for causing this situation.
I take back the good things I said bout this damn jackass!
Rufus
Well, enjoy your last moments together.
Heidegger
I'll tie your arms now.
Heidegger
Hey! Walk straight!
Scarlet
Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness to the world!
The hell are these people?
Scarlet
We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national television.
Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?
Scarlet
With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately need to rally public support… it's better that we punish somebody, anybody.
You make me sick…
Scarlet
Ha, ha, ha, ha !
They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!
Scarlet
We'll start with this girl.
If you've gotta do it…take me first!
Scarlet
Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats up tearful goodbyes!
Scarlet
This is my special gas chamber. Take your time and enjoy a slow painful death.
“”
Scarlet
Stuck up ^%$#&!!
What are you doing!?
Scarlet
What'd you do? Hey! Open it!
First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind!
Scarlet
Don't make me pry it open!
Gas!!
Gas!!
BARRET, help!!
Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!
Come on! I can't hold on forever!
Move your feet and arms, then use your
head to get out of the chair.

Emergency! Emergency!
Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take your positions!
Oh no! It's Weapon!
Run!
Scarlet
Hey, hey, all of you!
Scarlet
Damn! Why now?
How does it feel now, Scarlet?
Scarlet
Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right now…
Scarlet
Nngaaaaaahhhh!
Huh!? Sleeping gas?
Weirdo!!
I'm here to help!
Why you… Ain't you part of Shinra?
Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides…I hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help TIFA.
I'll keep watch at the entrance.
It won't open!
#$*&!
The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!
Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this room first.
TIFA! I'll help you, I promise!
Let's run to the airport!
The airport?
Trust me, trust me.
Scarlet
…Fools… I've already pushed the switch…
You can't pass.
Where you goin'? The airport's the other way.
No! They locked this too!
Scarlet
Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.
Scarlet
Ha, ha, ha, ha !!
Goddammit!!
OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!
Why the airport? An' leave TIFA there?
Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance.
Damn, man!
I know you're in a hurry! But, may have a word…
Shu'up!! I'm in a hurry!
Kiiiiin…
Don't make so much noise. It's me, ME! YUFFIE!
The hell you doin' here!?
I'll explain later! Now we gotta get to the airport!
Heidegger
It's Weapon.
Rufus
There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?
Heidegger
I believe so. Your orders?
Rufus
No need to ask.
Heidegger
We'll give it a shot from our big cannon.
Heidegger
Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!
The cannon…
Fire----!!!
Ready!
Rufus
Did we get 'em?
Heidegger
Seems so…
Weapon approaching!
Speed, 50 Knots!
It's heading right toward us!
Heidegger
It can't be! We hit it dead on!
Rufus
How about the cannon?
Heidegger
It'll take time to reload.
Rufus
Then use regular fire power in the meantime!
Heidegger
Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it land!
Speed, 70 Knots!
Weapon, closing in!!
Not good! It's attacking!
Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!
Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?
You damn cat! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!
Yo, better watch my back till the end…partner!
Scarlet
Our little game of hide and seek ends here.
Scarlet
The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by falling and crashing into the water below might still be pretty exciting.
Scarlet
Stuck up to the end!
Scarlet
How can you!?
What!?
Scarlet
You!!
Pay back!!
Scarlet
That hurts!
Stop it!
Scarlet
That's enough!
Same to you!!
[OK]…Slap
Quit slapping me! You old $*&^%!!! (Push [OK]!)
Scarlet
Take her away.
Scarlet
God! I can't stand it!
Scarlet
Why are you still standing there!? Catch her and take her away!
Scarlet
Now it's time to pay up. Calm down or I'll drop you!
Scarlet
Kya, ha, ha, ha !
Run…
Run to the end of the Cannon!!
Highwind
You okay?
My cheeks hurt a bit.
Forget it, what's all this about?
Well, I'll catch the details later.
In any case, the airship, Highwind, is now yours.
Ha! Ha…urk!
Well…I'm glad you're safe.
I'm going to stay up here a little longer.
…Urk…I get sick on ships either in the air or water.
I wonder where you're taking me?
Highwind
Dammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?
I thought… TIFA was gone for good.
Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.
Come on! Everyone is waiting!
Everyone? Everyone's here?
Yo, CID!
When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Leader-man, let's hurry.
CID????
…Urk… …I'm not down yet.
Highwind
Sorry!! Go speak to Captain CID!
TIFA, thank you for a job well done!
CID, thank you for a job well done!
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!

Don't care
Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.
Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.
We put up with this all the time, even when he beat us.
I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.
Let's see, it must've been a week ago…it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.
Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.
And with them, I saw CID, a legendary pilot!
And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic…
He even talked to us.
I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as warm-hearted as we'd always heard.
CID said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.
And now here we are off to save the Planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.
And that's why we decided to help.
After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire! Fire!'
In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.
That's how it happened. Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.
But BARRET and you were captured by Heidegger…
We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys before we finally could.
So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.
I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.
Huh?  Don't you want to test my memory on how we met CID?
I'm not just shooting the breeze! I'm also working!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you using Chocobos?
I mean, just loading them up and transporting them.
I wonder what everyone's going to do when this fight's over?
I wonder what's gonna happen to the Highwind?
Where's the next stop? Can't you get there any quicker?
CLOUD, put me in your party, so I can get off this ship.
Hmph!
I wonder why anyone would ever make an airship like this…
Ugh…ugh…
What? Are we there?
I know it's all for Wutai, But I can't take much more of this.
CLOUD…urp…ugh.
You know, I was thinking…phew… Why does Materia always have something to do with battles or magic?
I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.
It must've been…ugh…terrible…
Are you waiting for CLOUD?
He's flying right now, so you can't get him.
Were you going to force me into the submarine right now?
Quit it! If you want to go, then just leave me behind.
…ooooooh. What're you talking about? I…
What's the pilot like?
Tell him YUFFIE says if he pilots the plane smoothly, I'll give him my autograph…
Headed for…Midgar?
Uh, a, anywhere's fine…I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing.
CLOUD…sign this.
What is it?
It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the Materia will belong to me.
It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all right?
Forget it, I'm not even gonna read it.
Whenever I read, I get airsick.
Oh yeah?
I'm the same way, so I can't say too much.
Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on RED XIII later to let off steam.
Huh?
How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is…getting sick on boats and rides…
So, please…just leave me alone.
I really do understand, YUFFIE. When I get sick on a flight, it's a real killer.
When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion sickness.
Oh…
Isn't there any way to prevent this?
Well, according to my research…
First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick.
But you can't always be nervous.
With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding.
It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.
But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks.
That sucked!
And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding.
And that is…
Read!
Read!
Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do.
I know it's tough…
…So you’re a little better off than me.
But I don't feel…well.
Highwind
That's a good Chocobo.
I'm bored… I want to ride a Chocobo.
How do I?
Later
Whew…
Listen…you gotta ride in on a Chocobo you've raised yourself.
Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, you can let it rest here.
I'll take care of it for you.
What? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about that.
If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo ranch near Midgar. You should ask them.
Anyhow, to the world map...
I'm going.
I'm not goin'.
Highwind
Welcome to my airship-the Highwind!
What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!
CID…
Yeah…
Not enough crew.
Do you think we aren't strong enough without CLOUD?
Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?
Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage…
At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
No idea at all…
Get a hold of yourself, TIFA! C'mon, let's think about this!
No way we can get offa this train we're on!
If only CLOUD was here, everything would be fine.
CLOUD would…
…stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.
He'd say, 'Everything's under control, TIFA.'
TIFA! When'd you become such a wimp!
I'm sorry, BARRET.
I'm so depressed, I'm surprised at myself.
And TIFA…the reason why we all thought it was CLOUD was because…
I know.
That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again.
I want you to know I didn't dislike him.
I gotta admit he was a strange dude.
Just when you thought he was cool, he'd do some damn fool thing.
Then when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.
Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd.
Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.
Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday. So cheer up, sis.
…I'll be able to see him someday.
If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time.
Maybe…
CLOUD is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up…
Buried in the depths of the underground…
Deep within the earth…are you talking about the Lifestream?
The Lifestream sometimes gushes out from cracks in the ocean floor to the surface.
I heard about such a place.
Maybe, just maybe CLOUD's…
Pilot in training (LV3)
Yaaaaahh! Don't talk to me right now!
Get a hold of yourself!
Pilot in training (LV3)
Waaaaah! Captain CID!
TIFA, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship.
Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.
Oh, and TIFA…
No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.
Go to the Operation room and get ready.
I put a lot of things for you in the Operation room, so go get ready.
OK! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed.
Pilot in training (LV4)
Eagggghh! Are we going?
We're going
We're staying put
Pilot in training (LV4)
Eagggggh! We're off!
Well, it takes all kinds.
What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?
Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?
An' don' go tellin' us to wait for CLOUD to get better.
Oh, I've got some news.
Yeah, what!? That you a spy?
Yeah… I've already told you I was.
Both Gya ha ha and Kya ha ha are up to something.
Wanna eavesdrop?
Conference Room
Rufus
Now then… We're faced with two issues.
1 Destroy Meteor. 2 Remove the barrier around North Cave and defeat Sephiroth.
Any ideas?
Rufus
What?
Rufus
You're going to ram Meteor?
Do you think we have the technology to do it?
Heidegger
Gya haah hah hah! The first problem's already solved!
Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!
The plan is already in motion. We are collecting Huge Materia from each region.
Gyaa haa ha ha!
Heidegger
We've already collected Materia from Nibelheim. All that's left are Corel and Fort Condor.
I've already dispatched troops to Corel.
Scarlet
Huge Materia is a high-density, special type of Materia made through a special compression process in Mako reactors.
The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal Materia.
Kya, ha, ha! How about that!?
We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into Meteor.
That will cause a huge explosion, reducing Meteor literally to bits!!
Scarlet
First things first!
Right now, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area.
That's why we're here… CLOUD… CLOUD has…
Bugenhagen
I see… CLOUD has…
It's true that there are several places on the planet where the Lifestream is gathered.
But most of those places are below the surface where humans cannot reach them.
There's only one place An island in the Southern Sea… 
What did you say? I haven't left here in years… No good. I can't remember.
Bugenhagen
In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where the Lifestream is.
But even if you find CLOUD there…
The Lifestream is a mass of spiritual energy,
and one person alone couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current…
Bugenhagen
Listening to you and Nanaki speak has made me feel young again.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Might sound a little sarcastic.
Mideel
Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet little Hot Springs town.
Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our lives.
I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here it's still nice and quiet.
Ahoy! This here's Mideel. A quiet Hot Springs town… At least it used to be…
Lately the sea's been in a tizzy. Lifestream has been mixin' things up at the bottom of the ocean.
I think the Planet's pretty angry, too. We've pretty much done whatever we've wanted to the Planet up till now.
Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're things on the outside?
Between the earthquakes and Meteor… It just might be the end of the world like everyone's been sayin'…
Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is…
It's bad enough with earthquakes and Meteor, but on top of all that now the Lifestream has become active again, too.
I hope it doesn't blow and cause a panic like it did before. That was really bad, I tell ya.
Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your turn. The world's gotta end sometime.
Everybody goes sometime or another. And everyone gets left too. It's just fate…
It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So that's why I'm prayin' for all of you.
That kid got a green stone from that Chocobo! I'm so jealous.
What's the matter? Are you all alone?
You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love? Silly thing…
I guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore… Poor pokey-headed young thing…
It was really sad…but weird. He was holding this really long sword.
I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes…
Wha!?
Wh…wait a minute!! What did you just say!?
Excuse me! That person you were just talking about…
Yeah…a villager found him a little ways down the coast… It was about a week ago I think.
Poor kid… He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away.
CLOUD!! It must be!! It's CLOUD!!
You sure!?
Uh…!? Yo, TIFA!!
Over here!
Halt!
Heh, good job, TIFA.
BINGO!!
Oh, HEY!
Jackpot!
Wait up!
You've found him.
So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now?
Yeah…up ahead here… At the, uh, clinic…
He's alive!
CLOUD… CLOUD's alive!!
CLOUD!!
So how is the boy? Poor kid. He sure got the worst of whatever it was…
Sure hope he gets better soon. Right now is when he really needs to hold on and not give up.
It's amazing he recovered. When they carried him here after they first discovered him, I thought for sure he was a goner.
That boy must have one powerful guardian angel watchin' over him.
Huh? What could that be?
There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key… It's hard to get out.
Well, I'll just let it go for now…
There's something stuck deep inside that looks like an old key…
Huh? The hell's this?
Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside, and I can't get it out.
Well, what the hell? That's life…
Hey…what's that? Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside and
I wonder if there's some way to get this outta here.
If I just move this… And push that… Okay! I got it out!
Okay, there's gotta be a way to get it out.
Maybe if I move this a bit… and push that over… HAH! Gotcha!
Received "Beat-up Useless Old Key"!
Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!! We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else. But it's first come, first served, so get yours now!
Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside. Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!
I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town like this. What's with him? …sigh…
What's this?
The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the earth!
Damn, that's… This is bad!!
CID!? What's wrong?
N, nothin'!! You and CLOUD get inside quick!!
But I…
Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that easily.
Be careful!
Okay, here I go! Watch this!!
Mideel Residence
You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall from the sky? Is that for real?
I still don't believe it! How could this happen?
Ancient Weapon? End of the world? Malarky! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!
There's still tons of stuff I gotta do! This's just the beginning.
And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're useless!!
Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I only work in this accessory store part-time.
Our goods compare with the best goods anywhere. So, how about one?
Thank you. Stop by again.
Mideel Residence
I gotta feelin' something bad's gonna happen. Is everything gonna be okay?
I'm all right. I've lived a long, full life.
But I'm worried about my son and his family living in that far-off town…
I hope they're safe…
Received "Elixir"!
Wait a minute.
Did you just take something?
Uh, oh. I'm…
Yeah, I took it, old man!
I know nothin' about it!
Hey, it's mine now! An' I'll make good use of it, believe-you-me!
Heh, heh. What an oddball. We'll let him use it.
Hey thanks. It'll help, pops!
Wh, wh-huh…? I don't know nuthin' about that.
What the hell happened to that rotten old elixir I was gonna throw out?
If someone took that by mistake it'll do more than make them sick…
Well, if you don't know then I guess you don't know.
…
Mideel Weapon Store
So that overgrown moon's gonna fall on us, huh?
This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies before they're all gone!
Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it!
You again! You aren't hoarding up goods too, are you?
Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!
I've got money to burn! I've been saving like mad just for a time like this!
C'mon, outta the way! Move, will you, move!
Oh…not much time left!! You never know when that moon's gonna come crashing down!!
When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things! If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!
Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!!
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What can I get you today?
Thank you very much! Please come again.
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! Unfortunately, regarding the place you'd like to go…
The other customers have booked it all up… I'm afraid nothing's left.
…just kidding! Ha, hah, hah! Now how can I help you?
No good… I wonder if it's locked?
No good… Someone must've locked it.
Hmm…you really locked this one up good.
Damn, why the hell did they make something tricky like this?
…The key broke off inside, and I can't get to it…
… I don't know anything about it.
…The key broke off inside, and I can't get to it…
… I don't know a thing about it…
Oh yeah, shall I try that old beat up key?
Hey, I know what'll do it… Let's try that beat up old key!
Use the beat up old key!
Forget it
I'd better not. It doesn't look like it fits.
Naw, forget it… It doesn't even look like it fits.
Okay, this is it.
Yeah, this is it.
Hmm…Huh? This is pretty tight…
Huh? Wha? Won't turn…
Eyaaah!?
Wha?
Oh no! …it broke. Now I can't get it out…
Hoo, *&%$^% Busted it… Can't get the damn thing out…
Is something wrong?
Ulp!?
Ulp!!
Huh? Uh, no…
What am I gonna do?
Lie your butt off!
Tell them the truth!
Oh, uh, no, uh I…
Damn, this's bad…
What the hell…lie!
Just apologize and get it over with!
Nothing! I was just thinking how nice that door was, that's all.
Er, nothin'. Hah, hah. That's one nice door you got there, y'know.
Oh…why, thank you very much.
Whew…that was close. But I feel bad…
Phew…that was a close one. But I kinda feel a little bad about it.
I'm…sorry! I forced the key and it broke!
Mmm…sorry! I twisted the ^%$#^ and it broke.
Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?
Hah, hah, hah! That's a good one!
???
???
Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
What!? It's not a real door?
Say what? You drew that door on the wall?
That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.
Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
Really? Thank you.
TIFA and the others
received "Cursed Ring"!
Oh, uh…well Thanks.
CID and the others
received "Cursed Ring"!
We're hoping to pass through a door like that one into another world.
I feel that you all might be able to make my dreams come true. Weird, isn't it?
What is it? You're being awful friendly all of a sudden.
Oh, so that's it. You want the Mimmet Greens…don't you?
Give it some Mimmet Greens
Don't give it any
Sorry, little guy. I can't give you any.
Well, okay. Here, go ahead and eat.
hee hee…how cute! I just want to tickle him.
What's this!? You're bein' awful friendly.
Oh, so that's it. You want the Mimmet Greens…don't you?
Give it some Mimmet Greens.
Don't give it any.
Sorry, shorty. But I can't give ya any.
Well, guess there's no way around it. Here ya go, shrimp. Eat up.
Heh heh, hey he's kinda cute. Aw, maybe I'll just tickle him a little.
The chocobo looks like it enjoyed eating the Greens.
Tickle his feet
Tickle his stomach
Tickle his neck
Tickle his belly button
Tickle behind his ears
Tickle under his arms
The chocobo looks like it loves that.
The chocobo looks a little ticklish.
The chocobo looks a little angry.
The chocobo looks a little shy.
The chocobo looks bored.
Dined and dashed.
Received Materia from the Chocobo!
But you've got too much Materia
you can't take on anymore…
The chocobo put the Materia away.
Oh, you scared me…! I thought you were dead!
Sheesh, you scared me. I thought you croaked!!
Chocobos ignore humans who
don't look like they'll give them greens.

Mideel Clinic
CLOUD!?
Doctor
Hey! You barged in here like Meteor was crashing down or something.
I'm sorry…but I heard a friend of mine was here…
Doctor
A friend?
Doctor
Oh…that young fellow!?
Don't worry. He's next door. But his condition isn't good.
Here?
Over here.
CLOUD!?
Oh…CLOUD!! I'm so glad you're safe!?
…!?
CLOUD?
Uh…aaa…?
Wh…what's wrong… CLOUD?
Aaa..gurk..
CLOUD! What happened to you?
Doctor
Mako poisoning… Quite an advanced case.
It appears this young man's been exposed to high levels of Mako energy for an extended period of time.
He probably has no idea who or where he is now…
Poor fellow, he can't even speak. He's literally miles away from us.
Some place far away where no one's ever been… All alone…
Doctor!!
This's bad…
How horrible…
That's terrible…
Damn, that's evil.
You lyin' or what!?
…
CLOUD…
Doctor
Ahem! Let's excuse ourselves.
Doctor
Listen, would you all mind… waiting outside?
…
Why? What do you want me to do?
Please, CLOUD… Talk to me…
Tell me you see me, that you can hear me… Tell me, please…
I made it this far believing in the memories we shared.
This isn't happening! It's too cruel!
Oh, CLOUD! I…
I don't care about anything else, only CLOUD…
I…want to be by his side…
Yeah, that's probably best…
For CLOUD… and you…
Yes, that's best!
Yeah. Right. Hang in there, TIFA.
Then you gotta do it. You gotta be true to yourself.
If TIFA were my nurse, I'd switch places with CLOUD any day!
Do what you wish.
I'm sorry, everyone… Especially now…
Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.
You take care now, TIFA. And take care of CLOUD.
Don't worry. I'll stop by again.
You hang in there, TIFA. Take care of CLOUD.
That's all right. We'll be by again.
Do your best, TIFA. Take care of CLOUD.
No big, no big. I'll pop in again later.
Look after CLOUD. Take care, TIFA.
What're you talkin' about? We'll stop in again.
Hope CLOUD gets better soon.
Don't worry. We'll return and check on him later.
Take care of him.
Right…
Oh, and uh, TIFA… I don't like askin' this but…
Are you sure he's really your friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?
Huh!? Well…that is…
No, I'm sure of it!
Yeah? OK, then… Sorry for askin'.
We gotta get back to the Highwind.
Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind.
We should be getting back to the Highwind.
Hey, shouldn't we be gettin' back to the Highwind?
Well, I guess we'd better go back to the Highwind.
Very well then, we should return to the Highwind.
Mideel
So what about him?
You know… CLOUD?
Listen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth.
What about CLOUD? Is he all right?
Tell me doctor, is CLOUD all right? I mean will he heal?
Hey Doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?
Hey doctor, is CLOUD all right? Is he gonna get better? Come on, tell us the truth
Doctor
I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad…
An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was infused into his brain.
It's a miracle he survived! No normal human could have.
No wonder… After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here…
No wonder… After all, he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.
No wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and washed up here…
No lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.
No wonder. After falling into the Lifestream…
Doctor
But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.
If you give up hope… What will happen to him?
…hope…
Hey, but honestly, man… Do I really want him to come back?
What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow…
Doctor
Is something wrong?
No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, Doc.
…Hope…
I guess that's all that's left now…
Hmm, I know he'll recover! CLOUD was a strong member of SOLDIER.
Yeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better!
Yeah! I know CLOUD'll get better!
With friends like us worrying about him He'll pull through.
…
You okay?
You okay?
Are you all right, TIFA?
You okay, TIFA?
You all right?
Yes… I'm sorry to worry you all.
There's something I want to say to you…
Corel!
What else can they do to Corel!?
And the Huge Materia…
You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.
When our small Materia nears the larger one, there should be some reaction.
I'm certain of it. That's why we're using the Materia power in our fight…
Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!
Besides, when CLOUD gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked.
So, what are you saying, BARRET?
Even though you're always knocking him, you really want CLOUD to return.
I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. So just…shut your face!
Every group's gotta have a leader.
An' that's me!
Or at least I wanna be… But I ain't cut out to be no leader.
I never knew that till lately.
That's what it is.
…ZZZZ…hmph?
Wha? What's goin' on?
You been chosen to be the new leader.
Pain in the ass. Forget it.
But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.
We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!
That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can do it.
Hmm…this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?
Oh man, stab me in the heart.
I'm a man, too!
Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!
Alright, now here's the first job.
The Operation Room's waiting for you!
Yeah!!
As soon as we're ready, we'll head for the Corel reactor.
Hurry, CID!
Pilot in training (LV5)
Eaggggghh! Congrats' on becoming our leader, Cap'n!
Pilot in training (LV5)
Yaaah! Are we taking off?
Yes
No
Pilot in training (LV5)
Eagggggh! We're taking off now!
Hey…
It's tough being the leader.
CLOUD did a great job. Sheesh…
Shall we go to Mideel to check on things?
I wonder how CLOUD's doing.
I wonder if TIFA needs a break…
I could look after him instead.
Well, let's see… What's a good place to head to?
Corel? Fort Condor?
Where shall we go next? Shall we head for the Corel reactor?
What's next? Shall we head for Fort Condor?
Pilot in training (LV6)
Yaah! Shall we take off?
Yes
No
Pilot in training (LV6)
Yaah! We're taking off!
What's that sad face for?
What? Does CLOUD always gotta be around? We did fine without him in the beginning…
Right? An' what happened to the tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?
Whenever I think of CLOUD, everything gets all jumbled up.
No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans.
But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us.
Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do.
Yo, Leader-man! Get your pilot ass up here!
Leader-man? What's next!?
Yo, wanna see what TIFA and the gang are doing?
Cheer up, TIFA…
There appears to be a small island near the Lifestream……
They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the Southern island.
I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else…
I'm sorry…TIFA.
We'll do our best for CLOUD and you.
…And AERIS, too.
CID.
Let's visit CLOUD and TIFA from time to time.
Say CID.
I wonder how TIFA and CLOUD…are doing.
TIFA.
You saw him slapping Scarlet around?
Yeah, he did a good job, too. It felt good just watching.
Let's never forget that spirit, and give it our all!
TIFA, I'll give you info on Shinra.
Ask me if there's anything you don't understand.
Everything appears calm right now at Shinra.
So now's the time to look for CLOUD. I'm worried about him, too.
I wonder where CLOUD is. Or could he already be…
TIFA… Do you think it's a good idea for me to quit Shinra?
Oh, I'm sorry.
TIFA, there's no way I can quit right now…
CID, I'm expecting big things from you
CID, you're tired, huh?
I'd like to change places with you, but I'm in charge of information, so I can't. Sorry.
Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor, and…
I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was that…?
Shinra's…stopped.
Now we've got to be careful. I know Heidegger and his gang are plotting something.
…So glad you're all right, TIFA.
Too much hope is the opposite of despair.
An overpowering love may consume you in the end.
CID…I wish I had your go-get-them attitude.
It appears my feelings vanished into thin air ever since my long slumber….
…Don't expect me to do anything other than fight beside you.
I have no words of comfort. Of course, I don't believe you're the type who needs the kindness from others…
You look really tired, maybe you're ready to give up being leader?
No use singing the blues, baby. The best thing to do is to keep movin'.
Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things up!
Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
Good day, Captain!
All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us.
Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, Captain…
Pilot in Training (LV7)
Yaaah!  Shall we take off?
Roger
Negative
Pilot in Training (LV7)
Man!  We're taking off!
Guard
You guys are…
Guess we're safe for now…
Da---mn!
Ohh!
Wa…wait!
Wha…what is it, what is it?
!!
Looks like they're takin' off with the Huge Materia in that train!
NO! You damn boneheads!
Did the Shinra beat us!?
What are ya gonna do!? Huge Materia!?
Wha…you're not thinking about giving up…
…shall we go after them?
Hey, do you know who I am?
I'm CID - that's who the hell I am! Now just let me handle it!
Hey, hey, hey, hey---!
How can they even drive this?
It sure helped having CID here. I had no idea he could drive a train…
Pretty good for an old guy. I'm impressed you can move this thing!
Way to go, Mister! You used to drivin' this thing too?
I'm impressed. You can drive this too?
Don't ask me… I don't know!
What!?
Wa…What!?
What!? For serious!?
Huh?  What'd you just say!?
Wha…what…!?
Don't worry! I can handle this!
Two levers; one on the right and one on the left…
Left lever Right lever
(Directional button up) ([MENU])
I see, just alternate the two levers up and down, right!?
Judging from the enemy's speed, I'd say it'll take about 10 minutes.
We're gonna fly!! Hold on tight!!
All right! We're gonna jump!!
DAMN!
Sorry! I couldn't catch them!
Oh ^%$#&$! We're gonna crash into North Corel!
Guard
What the? You…you guys!
All right--- Hand over the Huge Materia!
Guard
Sh…
Whooooa----!
You got guts comin' after me!
I'll never forget you!
No time for that now!
We got it going, but how do we stop it?
Forget the Huge Materia, WE'RE the ones in deep trouble!
What are we gonna do, kill the engineer!?
Hit the brakes, Chief.
I KNOW, already! Just shut up and sit tight! If we keep this up, we'll crash right into North Corel!
Let's see… If we use the levers alternately to accelerate…
Left lever Right lever
(Directional button up) ([MENU])
(Directional button down) ([CANCEL])
It should stop if we move the levers up or down simultaneously!
Hey, it's not working!
We're gaining speed!
Hey-------WAIT! …other way, other way, other way!
Isn't it…the other way?
What are you doin', accelerating!?
^%#@! The other way!? Just watch, I'll…
Hey…HEY HEY!!
WHOOOOOO----A!!
Get serious, you OLD MAN!!
No…DON'T----!!
…!!
SH--------!!
North Corel
Of…of course! We're all born and raised in the coal mines!!
No matter how tough it gets, our hearts burn bright red like coal!
Aren't you the ones that stopped the Shinra Train?
The Shinra was just about to destroy our lives again…
That's it!
Hey, kid! How about givin' somethin' to these guys fighting' the Shinra?
To you it may be a junk yard, but to us its home.
It might be full of junk, but this is the only home we got, BARRET!!
Must've been a horrific battle. You have scars all over your body.
I already talked to the Inn's owner. Today you can rest for free.
To hell with Meteor! We're Coal Miners, ain't we?
We'll dig a deep tunnel and hide from the Meteor!
You guys are really something!
You sure are brave. I'm impressed!
Weapon Shop
You'll need weapons from our store, if you want to survive.
Accessory Shop
Please buy something. Anything!
If you see anything you like, buy it.
I got it out of the well. Isn't it an amazing rock!!
Whoops… You can't hold any more.
Here, I'll keep some in my pocket and you can come by later and get it, OK?
Received "Ultima" Materia!
Received Key Item "Huge Materia"!
North Corel
We've lost everything… Now we have to start again from ' 1'…no, from ' 0'.
God, what have we done?
Well, no use just sitting around talking about it. What can we do to get things back to normal?
While you guys were relaxing, Shinra troops took the Huge Materia.
The train's crashing in
Thank you, God, the train stopped.
It didn't do any damage.”
I heard that kid found something that glows.
Hey, what's this world coming to …?
Even the Gold Saucer is closing. So does that mean there's no time to be playing around?
Hey, the Golden Saucer reopened!
I guess that means we should play hard to forget about Meteor.
Weapon Shop
My store was all right!
Accessory Shop
I have a tool shop, but I don't have any tools to fix my store…
Yay! My house is finished!!
Um… where was the next train station?
^$#@%$ ! We couldn't stop the train…
The Huge Materia that Shinra is after… The last one left is at the Junon Underwater reactor.
Even if they are the Shinra, they should have a hard time with us getting in their way.
I don't think we have to hurry that much… …I just can't get that guy out of my head.
Yeah, and I'm worried how TIFA's doing, too.
Maybe we should go to Mideel to see how they are doing…
We have to do something about Shinra! Sick of hearin' about sad things like this!
I did it again… I can't keep up with this.
We'll get there before 'em!
CLOUD…
I could never forgive Shinra!
We HAVE to stop them!!
You must be talking about CLOUD…
I'd be sad if this place was my hometown…
We've got to hurry and stop them!!
You must mean CLOUD…
We got into this situation because we goofed…
Are we heading out to the Underwater reactor?
CLOUD…
A spectacular sight…
Are we going to the Underwater reactor?
CLOUD…
Received "Ultima" Materia!
I got a glowing rock from the well.
I'll sell it to you for 50000 gil!
Buy it
Don't buy it
You don't have enough money! Don't try to take advantage of me just because I'm a kid!!
I wish someone would buy this rock off of me…
Huh? You have lots of 'em!
You can't carry all of 'em. So I'm gonna keep it in my pocket…
It's Huge Materia that the Shinra's after… The only one left is in the underwater reactor in Junon.
We gotta get there first and protect it!!
We must get there first and stop them.
We got to get there first and stop them…
We've got to get there first and stop them.
Yeah, but since we got in their way the last time, they should've gotten a little more cautious.
I doubt they'll fly right into action. I'm more concerned about him than anything else.
CLOUD, it's you.
Yes, it's you CLOUD.
It is you CLOUD.
CLOUD…
CLOUD, it's you.
Yeah, and I'm worried that even TIFA's gonna fall over on her butt.
Let's go back and see what's happening… to Mideel…
Th, that light just now… The Condor… The egg…
What!? Would you go outside and see what it was?
Would you go check on it immediately?
Gone…
Oh, it's you. Thanks a lot.
Be sure and report to my father, too.
Oh, yeah. I found this just now on the battlefield. Maybe it'll come in handy for you guys.
Received "Magic Comb"!
Received "Peace Ring"!
Received "Megalixir"!
Received "Super Ball"!
Received three "Tincture"!
Received five "Potion"!
Received three "Turbo Ether"!
Received three "Elixir"!
Received three "Elixir"!
top of the mountain
Received "Phoenix" Materia!
Cannot take on anymore Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Everyone, thanks. I really mean it. Thanks.
Although there isn't anything we can give you, we'll make sure you can stop in and stay any time. So be sure to drop by.
Yes, yes, and there's one thing I forgot to tell you…
This…is…
What is this?
Damn man, it's Huge Materia.
This Materia is really out-of-this-world!
Wow, it's something!
Huh? What's this?
Gotta have that Materia!
Hmm, you mean this?
This is…
The truth is, this is the Materia inside the reactor.
Then you're telling me we protected a reactor that didn't have any Materia inside?
If that's the case, then you should have told us. There may have been another way to fight Shinra.
What the hell did we fight for?
We weren't protectin' the reactor, we were protectin' the Condor.
When that reactor was built, they forced us to help. That's how we knew what was inside the reactor.
I knew this day would come, so after the Shinra left, I sneaked in and took the Materia.
I didn't mean to fool you, but I guess that's how it ended up. I'm really sorry.
Well… Maybe it was for the best.
Besides, there was no guarantee we'd defeat Shinra.
No, I think what happened is good. Cause we didn't know if we'd win.
Just forget about it. Anyway, we're still alive.
I see. If you put it that way… we're really grateful.
So the last Huge Materia that Shinra's after's in the underwater reactor in Junon?
We gotta get there first and beat 'em no matter what!
We must get there before them and stop them!
We gotta get there and stop 'em…
Getting to the reactor before them…
But ya know, Shinra's probably on high alert since we always mess with 'em.
How 'bout we take a break and go see that little fella for a bit?
You mus' mean CLOUD.
You mean, CLOUD?
CLOUD, right?
You must mean CLOUD.
You mean CLOUD?
Yeah, I'm worried 'bout TIFA. She may've collapsed takin' care of the guy.
How 'bout checkin' in on 'em? Down to Mideel!
She's always there right by his side. She must really love him.
Even at a time like this You've got to be strong like her.
Sometimes he mumbles about numbers… I wonder what it means?
She's finally beginning to look a little tired… I hope she's all right.
No change in his condition, yet she stays right by his side. It must be tough on her.
If she keeps this up she's going to get sick…
Doctor
I'm sorry… But your friend's condition remains unchanged…
You'll have to be patient and wait this out. These things take time. Just like fine wine, time is of the essence.
A billion mirror fragments… small…light…
taken…angel's… singing voices… …Xeno…gears…
uh…a….aah…
…what… What number….am I?
CLOUD… I don't understand a word.
I'm such a fool…… I thought I could do something to help…
…It's no use…I don't understand a thing, CLOUD.
What should I do? What if you never recover for the rest of your life?
Eyaaah!?
Oh no… It's…
…coming…. They're…coming…!!
What did you say, CLOUD!?
Damn. What the hell's goin' on!?
Doctor
This is bad!! This one's big!
Eyaaah! I hate earthquakes!!
Oh god… The tremors are getting worse.
Wait a minute, CLOUD.
Doctor! Shouldn't we move him somewhere?
Doctor
Hmm…It might be safer to move to an open area.
Don't you worry about a thing, CLOUD…
I'll see to it that you get somewhere safe!
Doctor
No! The structure can't take it!! * Hurry!
Yes!
Ready CLOUD? We're leaving now!!
Well anyhow… Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you get some rest?
OK! Perfect! Well then, take care.
Damn!! That &%$^%$ Weapon!!
Of all the times to show up!
OK then, come on!! You &$^%$!
You &^$#&$#  ! You tryin' to escape?
Damn, man. Just a little bit more an' I woudda smashed him…
Looks like the Lifestream's settled down now too.
Just a little more and I would have beaten him.
It looks like the Lifestream has settled as well.
No matter how many lives I get, it ain't enough!
Looks like the Lifestream's back under control, too.
I swear, next time, that guy's dead meat!
Well at least the Lifestream's back to normal.
Hmm… Looks like escape is its best skill.
And the Lifestream also appears to be normal.
…!?
Damn, you gotta be kiddin'!!
Th, this's bad! The main stream is kickin' up!!
Somethin' way bigger than that last one is on its way!!
No good!! Get outta here!!
But what about TIFA and CLOUD!?
But what about CLOUD and the others?
But what about TIFA and CLOUD!?
Goddammit!! Don't have time to worry about anyone other than yourself! Don't know when that stream'll blow…
Whoa!!
There's no time, hurry!!
TIFA!! CLOUD!! Get outta here!!
Wh, where am I?* What's happening? I…
Where's CLOUD? CLOUD, where are you!?
Huh…what? Who…?
Who is it? I can't hear…
Wait a minute! I know nothing about that!
No! It's not me! I'd never do anything like that!!
No! Stop it!! Stay back!
Somebody…help! Please!!
CLOUD,help me!!
Eyaaaaghh!!
… Where am I?
CLOUD!?
What is it, CLOUD? What is this?
You're searching, aren't you CLOUD? Searching…for yourself…
Is this the inside of your dreams? Or is it… your…subconscious?
I can help, too. We'll work together to try and get the real you back!
But… Where do we start?
It connects… to Nibelheim?
That's right…It's probably best to start from there…
Let's go have a look, CLOUD. I know it's not easy… I'll be here for you…
The gates of Nibelheim… Five years ago, Sephiroth passed through these gates…
And… That's how it all started…
That starry night at the well… The promise we made then… What if that memory was all a lie?
…A sealed up secret…wish…
Tender feelings… that no one can ever know…
If I could just get stronger… Then even TIFA would have to notice me…
So that was it?
Sorry, CLOUD.
If I had only remembered more clearly what happened, I could have done something sooner…
It's not your fault, TIFA.
But, I remember back when we were eight!
That's it! Now I know!
You weren't created five years ago.
My childhood memories weren't all made up!
Hang in there CLOUD! Just a little longer! You've almost found the real you!
Let's go back to Nibelheim again!
The truth is right there. We almost have the answer right in the palm of our hands.
There's nothing… I can say.
You must find the answer yourself.
If you can't, then…
Take your time, CLOUD. Slowly…little by little, OK?
You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth wasn't…CLOUD?
That starry night at the well… and our promises…What if the memory was all just a lie?
Don't hurry, CLOUD… Don't answer too quickly.
Just keep checking all those small emotions and it'll come back… Slowly…little by little…
Right…like the sky that night… the heavens were filled with stars…
…A sealed up secret…wish…
Tender feelings… that no one can ever know…
A promise under a starry sky… But what if that was just a memory TIFA imagined?
…A sealed up secret…wish…
Tender memories… no one can ever know.
You mean that member of SOLDIER who came with Sephiroth to Nibelheim wasn't CLOUD?
CLOUD, what about your other memories?
No, not memories.
A memory is something that is consciously recalled, right?
That's why sometimes it can be mistaken or wrong.
It's different from a memory locked deep within your heart.
That's why it must be a fake. If he could recall up that memory…
That's it! What about some memory that has to do with me?
If I say something, you can't remember it.
But if you say something, and I remember it, too… Then we'll know that's a memory.
Talk to me. About anything, some important memory to you…
Now that you mention it, why did you want to join SOLDIER in the first place?
I always thought it was a sudden decision.
…I was devastated. …I wanted to be noticed.
I thought if I got stronger someone would notice.
Someone to notice you? …Who?
Who? You know who!* …You, that's who.
You…
Me? Why!?
TIFA…Did you forget… about those days?
Look…I…
I'm sorry… But what are you talking about?
No…it's all right. You were having a hard time back then.
You were so busy with your own things, it's only natural you don't remember me then.
'Then'?
It's important to me… I hate to say it, but it's a very important memory.
Do you want to see it?
Oh…wait!
Come on, hurry.
Do you know where this window goes to, TIFA?
Fine…I'll go.
CLOUD.
Then…this is goodbye, TIFA. Until we meet again…
…!?
Uh…* Ah, uh…
CLOUD!!
Uh…% TIFA…
Oh, CLOUD! It's really you, isn't it?
Yeah…TIFA… We finally…meet again…
You stupid jerk!! You had us all worried sick!!
Krgh!
CLOUD!? Are you all right!?
V, voice…their…
I see. We're… in the Lifestream, aren't we?
Everyone's waiting.
Let's go back, CLOUD. Back to everyone…
Yeah, I guess so… Come on, TIFA. Let's go home…
Nibelheim
Sephiroth
How does it feel?
Sephiroth
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time‚right?
Sephiroth
So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown…
Ummm…how 'bout your parents?
Sephiroth
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me.
My father…
Sephiroth
What does it matter?
Sephiroth
All right‚let's go.
Sephiroth
The Mako smells pretty bad here.
Psst… (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
It's so boring‚being on watch.
You want to do what we always do?
Just sit tight‚it's your job‚right?
Shall we practice?
I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.
Practice… oh‚you mean practice my pose.
Do members of SOLDIER always have to worry about what others think?
…How did it go?
…Was it like this?
Good job!
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
CLOUD…look.
Here's the well…
And that's Gramps' Inn, too.
The only truck in town. It's been here since we were little kids, right?
This is the Nibelheim you remember, right?
It's the same as my Nibelheim. That's why this is…our Nibelheim.
Five years ago…two men from SOLDIER came…
Sephiroth and… a young and vibrant soldier.
Can you tell me again what happened?
No, CLOUD.
I've been hiding it for some time, afraid that if I told you …something terrible might happen.
But, I'm not going to hide anything anymore.
You weren't here. CLOUD did not come to Nibelheim five years ago.
I…waited. But, CLOUD…never came.
The two that were ordered here were Sephiroth and another person…
Five Years ago…I saw the real Sephiroth for the very first time.
So this is…the Great Sephiroth?
But to tell the truth, I thought he was very cold.
I remember a foreboding about him.
Sephiroth
This is your hometown, right?
From the beginning…OK?
Try and remember, CLOUD.
…I was wearing these clothes.
That's you, too. You were so small then…
…and cute.
Sephiroth once said…
CLOUD made up his memories by listening to my stories…
Did you imagine this sky? No, you remembered it.
That night the stars were gorgeous. It was just CLOUD and I. We talked at the well…
He remembered our promise too…
That's why I kept thinking you were the real CLOUD.
I still believe you're the CLOUD from Nibelheim…
But you don't believe in yourself…
These memories aren't enough.
…I wonder if there's anything beyond that mountain?
Mt. Nibel is scary. Many people have died there.
No one crosses that mountain alive…
How 'bout those that died?
Did mama pass through the mountains?
I'm going!
I don't remember the path I walked.
TIFA missed her step. I ran to her…but didn't make it in time.
We both fell off the cliff.
Back then, I only scarred my knees but…
Tifa's Dad
CLOUD! Why'd you bring TIFA to a place like this!
What the hell's the matter with you!?
Tifa's Dad
What if she dies!?
TIFA was in a coma for seven days.
We all thought she wouldn't make it.
If only I could've saved her…
I was so angry… at myself for my weakness.
Ever since then, I felt TIFA blamed me…
I went out of control… I'd get into fights with anyone.
That was the first time I heard about Sephiroth.
I thought if I were strong like Sephiroth, then…
TIFA's House
CLOUD's coming!
You think he wants to come in?
Was that the first day you came into my room?
…that's right.
We lived next to each other. But I really didn't know you that well.
I've known you since we were children and always thought we were close…
That's right…
I…really didn't know CLOUD that well.
That's why I was a bit surprised when CLOUD asked me to come out to the well.
TIFA was so popular and I never played much with the others…
But, but listen! After CLOUD left town, I thought about him a lot.
I thought, I wonder how CLOUD is doing?
I wondered if he was able to get into SOLDIER?
I even started reading the newspaper, just to see if CLOUD was in any of the articles.
I want…to see…Mom…
TIFA's House
My room?
It was my first time there.
Was it?
I only used to look up at it from outside.
Hey, look!
Now that you mention it…I don't recall you ever being in my room…
TIFA always used to have her own group.
…That's right.
I thought they were all…stupid.
What!?
You were all childish, laughing at every little stupid thing.
But we were children then.
…I know. I was the stupid one.
I really wanted to play with everyone, but you never let me in the group.
Then later…I started thinking I was different…
That I was different from those immature kids.
That then…maybe…
Just maybe, they would invite me in.
I thought that might happen, so I hung around…
I was so prejudiced. …And weak.
That night I asked TIFA to come out to the well…
I thought to myself TIFA would never come…that she hated me.
…It was so sudden. I was a bit…surprised.
But…
It's true we weren't THAT close, but…
After you left town, I really thought about you a lot.
I used to wonder how CLOUD was doing.
I wondered if you were able to get into SOLDIER?
I started reading the newspapers, thinking I might see an article about you.
Thanks, TIFA.
Tell him what you told me, later. He'll probably be so happy.
OK!
Huh?
What happened on this day? Was it a special day?
This was the day…
TIFA's mother…
The day Mom died…
Nibelheim
CLOUD, wait.
Where are you going?
……The reactor……?
To the reactor! The Mako reactor of five years ago!
Yeah…this is…me.
Not in SOLDIER, just a common grunt.
I…never made it as a member of SOLDIER.
I even left my hometown telling everyone I was going to join, but…
I was so embarrassed… I didn't want to see anybody…
Zack
Hey CLOUD. If you're feeling sick, why don't you take that mask off?
Yeah…
It sure is raining hard.
Hey‚how are you doing?
I'm all right.
I wouldn't know…
I've never had motion sickness,
Everything okay?
Sephiroth
Hey.
Sephiroth
Settle down.
They gave me some new Materia.
I can't wait to use it.
Sephiroth
…Just like a kid.
You going to brief us about this mission?
Sephiroth
…This isn't a typical mission.
Good!
Sephiroth
Why do you say that?
I joined SOLDIER so I could be like you.
But by the time I made First Class, The war was already over.
My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.
That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.
Say‚how do you feel‚ MISTER Sephiroth?
Sephiroth
…I thought you wanted a briefing?
Sephiroth
Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.
Sephiroth
There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.
First‚we will dispose of those creatures. Then‚we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.
Brutal creatures…? Where?
Sephiroth
The Mako reactor at Nibelheim.
Nibelheim…
That's where I'm from.
Sephiroth
Hmm…hometown…
Sir…s‚something strange just crashed into our truck!
Sephiroth
That would be our monster…
Sephiroth
Come on‚let's go to work.
Nibelheim
He---y! Is anyone here?
Zangan
Give me a hand!
Zangan
Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?
Zangan
Then come over here and help me!
Zangan
I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
Zangan
Hey! What about the other houses?
…Sephi…roth
…Hey, ummm… Am I going to die?
Terrible…
Sephiroth… This is too terrible…
What's…next?
Stop it already!!
This is bad… Just like Corel.
This is terrible… Did Sephiroth do this?
This is insane…
Wow… I didn't know it was THIS bad…
All this happened while I slept?
This is terrible…
…This is what actually happened five years ago.
But…
It's probably not me that will come out of the Shinra mansion.
He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion.
See…didn't I tell you?
I don't want to…watch this. CLOUD…Don't watch.
…What's wrong, TIFA? I told you before, right?
As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need to be scared.
I'm…
Hey! It's CLOUD!
Za…ck…Zac…k. Zack…
You remembered!!
That's right! It was Zack who came to Nibelheim with Sephiroth!
Then, where were you, CLOUD?
CLOUD… Did you…see it all?
I saw…everything…
Sephiroth
Aaarrrgh…who…who are you?
Mom… TIFA…My town…give it back…
I had so much respect for you… I admired you…
CLOUD!?
That's what happened…
…You were there.
You were watching me.
…You came. …You kept your promise.
So you really did come when I was in trouble!
Sorry… I didn't get there…sooner…
It's all right…CLOUD.
Sephiroth
Just like you.
Zack
CLOUD… Kill Sephiroth…
Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth
Don't…push it…
Sephiroth
…It can't be!
Yo! You alright!? TIFA!?
u…unn…?
BARRET… You came back. I…
CLOUD… Where is he?
Don't worry about him. He's a tough one.
BARRET…I… When I was in the Lifestream, I saw the real CLOUD.
I mean, I didn't really find him. CLOUD…he found himself…
Alright, I know… I shouldn't have doubted.
But I can't win against you. You're some kinda lady.
People have so many things pent up inside of themselves…
So many things they can never forget.
Strange…isn't it?
Yo, TIFA! Snap outta it!!
TIFA!?
CLOUD, I was deeply moved by your story!
I'm really a weak person and so I could really understand how you feel, CLOUD!
No one knows when fighting will begin. But let's get ready!
Thank you for a job well done!
Oh…oh… CLOUD…
Your command?
(PHS)
(SAVE)
(HP/MP restored!)
Everyone…I'm sorry. I don't know what to say…
Don't say anything, CLOUD. All you've been doing is apologizing.
I never was in SOLDIER.
I made up the story about what happened five years ago and my being in SOLDIER.
I left my village looking for glory, but never made it into SOLDIER…
I was so ashamed of being so weak. Then I heard this story from my friend Zack…
And I created an illusion of myself made up of what I had seen in my life…
And I continued to play the charade as if it were true.
Illusion, huh? Pretty damn strong for an illusion.
Physically, I'm built like someone in SOLDIER.
Hojo's plan to clone Sephiroth wasn't that difficult. It was just the same procedure they use when creating members of SOLDIER.
You see, someone in SOLDIER isn't simply exposed to Mako energy.
Their bodies are actually injected with Jenova cells…
For better or worse, only the strong can enter SOLDIER. It has nothing to do with the Jenova Reunion.
But weak people…like me, get lost in the whole thing.
The combination of Jenova cells, Sephiroth's strong will, and my own weakness are what created me.
Everyone knew that. I'm…CLOUD.
…the master of my own illusionary world.
But I can't remain trapped in an illusion anymore… I'm going to live my life without pretending.
You're sure messed up, CLOUD!
That means he ain't no different from before!
By the way, CLOUD. What are you going to do now?
Don't tell me you're going to leave the ship?
…I'm the reason why Meteor is falling towards us.
That's why I have to do everything in my power to fight this thing.
Good!! Then you're gonna keep fightin' to save the Planet!?
It's like you always told me, BARRET.
Oh, uh, you mean that!
What? I don't understand!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train we on!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train!
There ain't no gettin' offa this train!
Let's do it, CLOUD!
Yeah…huff…heave…
Are you okay?
…I hate moving vehicles. I always get sick.
That's too bad…
But that's okay. That's the real me.
There ain't no gettin' offa this train!
Mideel
Ahoy! This here's Mideel. As you can see, this used to be a quiet hot springs town.
Everything's gone now but in a way, I'm kinda glad everything's cleaned out. Feels better this way, ho, ho.
Have you seen my husband? He disappeared during the big earthquake and I haven't seen him since.
I thought he'd be in the store… You don't think he got through that door and went to another country on the other side, do you?
That's all just a dream… That could never really happen. Heh…
Welcome! We always welcome cash! What can I do for you today?
I'm sorry. Our stock isn't so great now… But that's just the way it is here.
If you're looking for other items, why don't you check out the other stores?
Welcome. Just what you need at a time like this--a shop of rest and relaxation. What ya want?
Thank you! We don't have many goods but you come again, please.
Hee, hee. Welcome It's here. The day's finally come! Your day to shop!!
Do we have items and weapons!? Well, I should say so. And here's a bargain! What would you say to 50% off everything?
Just kidding. Even I wouldn't do something like that. Now what can I do for you today?
Show me your items
Show me some weapons
Show me some Materia
Let me outta here
Thank you. Come again!
Hey, you feelin' all better now? That's good, real good. Now don't overdo yourself like that again, hear?
Isn't the Lifestream a strange thing?
When I die, I wonder if I'll float along in the middle of a warm gentle stream like this?
Doctor
Hmph! You!? How did you get over your Mako poisoning?
It's absolutely amazing… I am so glad for you! Looks like your friends' wishes came true.
You can see for yourself what things are like, but at least no one was seriously hurt. We're just very unhappy now.
You probably don't remember, but you know that girl that watched over you for so long when you were sick?
You'd better be good to her. If you don't, you'll be sorry. Believe me!

Who's this? Say, why are you being so friendly?
Oh, so this is it? You like the Mimmet Greens, don't you?
Give it some Mimmet Greens
Don't give it any!
Sorry, peewee But I can't give you any.
Well, I guess it won't hurt. Here, shorty, eat up.
Ha, ha. You're pretty cute. Here, I'm gonna tickle you a bit.
The Chocobo devoured the Greens.
Tickle the bottom of its feet
Tickle its stomach
Tickle its neck
Tickle its belly button
Tickle behind its ear
Tickle under its arm
The Chocobo looks happy.
The Chocobo looks ticklish.
The Chocobo looks angry.
The Chocobo looks shy.
The Chocobo looks bored.
Dined and dashed.
Received Materia from the Chocobo!
But you have too much Materia already.
You can't take on anymore…
The Chocobo put the Materia away.
Hey, don't surprise me like that! I thought you were dead!
Well anyhow… Hey, you all look terrible. Why don't you rest up for a while?
OK! Perfect! Well then, take care.
Oh great. Now I've got to find another job… I guess I might as well make my side job as an accessory seller into my regular job.
Well, since you're already here, why don't you buy something to take back with you?
Thank you. Stop by again.
Chocobos ignore humans who don't look like they'll give them greens.
