Mystery House
Chocobo Sage's House
Ho ho. It's unusual for people to come to such an out of the way place…
I can't remember how long it's been since my last guest.
Who are you?
Who are you?
Who are you?
Me? I'm…
I don't know.
You don't know who you are?
Wha? You don't know who you are?
Huh? You're sayin' you don't even know who you are?
Been a while since I gave it any thought…
What was it they used to call me?
Oh yeah!! They used to call me the 'Chocobo Sage'. That's right!!
Right, that was it, The Chocobo Sage!!
(No one would forget that)
(Who would forget that?)
(The hell's wrong with this guy?)
Chocobo Sage
Now what can I do for you?
Sell me something?
What about that Chocobo?
You remember anything?
That Chocobo? Well that one is…
Let's see now, I don't quite remember…
I remember now! That's the one they call…
It's a Mountain Chocobo. And like the name says, he can cross any mountain.
There is another one that can cross rivers, too. They call him a 'River Chocobo'.
Where can we catch one?
Where can we find one?
Where can I get one of those Whatdyacallem Chocobos?
There aren't any around now.
… That's one right there, isn't it?
What about that one right there?
What're you flappin' about? There's one right there!
Wha? I wonder what he's doing there?
Can't remember for the life of me…
…was bred from a Great Chocobo' and a Good Chocobo'.
If you give them "Carob Nuts" during breeding, there's a chance you'll get one of these Chocobos.
So where's this Chocobo?
So where can I get some of these 'Carob Nuts'?
So where can I find those Chocobos?
…And what about those 'Carob Nuts'?
So where is this Chocobo?
And what about those nut things?
Huh? Where? Where was that?
And what was that nut?
…Is on an island southeast of here, In a place called Mideel surrounded by greenery.
You should be able to catch one just west of Mideel. And some Carob Nuts', too.
There used to be some monsters just south of here that had them. Or you might…
… Funny…I forgot What I was saying just now.
Oh right!
It was about the Mountain Chocobo and the River Chocobo I told you about.
When you mate these two together…
…You get one that can cross rivers AND mountains.
And… And…uh, what was I saying?
Oh, yeah! And also…
There's one that can cross oceans, too!
You probably don't remember but…
How can I get one of those Chocobos?
You probably forgot already but…
How can I get one of those Chocobos?
Great! I know you probably already forgot but,
Where can I get one of those Chocobos?
Hey, don't talk like that! To get an Ocean-crossing Chocobo, you just…
Let's see now… …Nope. Don't remember a thing.
Oh, I remember! The Ocean-crossing Chocobo is…
The Mountain-and-River-crossing Chocobo is…uh… Oh, what was I saying?
Right, right! I remember! You take the Mountain-and-River-crossing Chocobo…
Mate it with a 'Wonderful Chocobo' you can catch right around here… And you'll get…
A chocobo that can cross the ocean will be born. Oh, but for that to happen...
You’ll need a certain type of nut. Just what type was it again...
Oh, right! You'll need a…
'Zeio Nut'. Now let me see, as I remember, the Zeio Nut…
Where was it you could find those things?
Oh yeah! Zeio Nuts…
Are the favorite of goblins. There's a small island east of here where the goblins have a bunch of them.
I think…
…that's all I'm gonna remember.
Oh!
That's it…
