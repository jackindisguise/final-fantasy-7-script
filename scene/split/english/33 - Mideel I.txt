Mideel
Ahoy! Hey ain't you a beaut. This here's Mideel. It's a quiet little Hot Springs town.
Just the perfect place for old folks like us to live out our lives.
I hear that things ain't so peaceful on the outside. But here it's still nice and quiet.
Ahoy! This here's Mideel. A quiet Hot Springs town… At least it used to be…
Lately the sea's been in a tizzy. Lifestream has been mixin' things up at the bottom of the ocean.
I think the Planet's pretty angry, too. We've pretty much done whatever we've wanted to the Planet up till now.
Huh? Never seen you here before. You from outta town? How're things on the outside?
Between the earthquakes and Meteor… It just might be the end of the world like everyone's been sayin'…
Oh, how depressing! What a miserable world this is…
It's bad enough with earthquakes and Meteor, but on top of all that now the Lifestream has become active again, too.
I hope it doesn't blow and cause a panic like it did before. That was really bad, I tell ya.
Everything must come to an end. And someday it's gonna be your turn. The world's gotta end sometime.
Everybody goes sometime or another. And everyone gets left too. It's just fate…
It's sad, but there's nothing that can be done about it. So that's why I'm prayin' for all of you.
That kid got a green stone from that Chocobo! I'm so jealous.
What's the matter? Are you all alone?
You got lost didn't you? Separated from someone you love? Silly thing…
I guess it's been about a week now since he washed up here on the shore… Poor pokey-headed young thing…
It was really sad…but weird. He was holding this really long sword.
I dunno. The whole thing feels unlucky to me. But the amazing thing was those weird blue eyes…
Wha!?
Wh…wait a minute!! What did you just say!?
Excuse me! That person you were just talking about…
Yeah…a villager found him a little ways down the coast… It was about a week ago I think.
Poor kid… He must've drifted from somewhere pretty far away.
CLOUD!! It must be!! It's CLOUD!!
You sure!?
Uh…!? Yo, TIFA!!
Over here!
Halt!
Heh, good job, TIFA.
BINGO!!
Oh, HEY!
Jackpot!
Wait up!
You've found him.
So where is he? Is he safe!? Where is he now?
Yeah…up ahead here… At the, uh, clinic…
He's alive!
CLOUD… CLOUD's alive!!
CLOUD!!
So how is the boy? Poor kid. He sure got the worst of whatever it was…
Sure hope he gets better soon. Right now is when he really needs to hold on and not give up.
It's amazing he recovered. When they carried him here after they first discovered him, I thought for sure he was a goner.
That boy must have one powerful guardian angel watchin' over him.
Huh? What could that be?
There's something stuck deep inside that looks like a key… It's hard to get out.
Well, I'll just let it go for now…
There's something stuck deep inside that looks like an old key…
Huh? The hell's this?
Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside, and I can't get it out.
Well, what the hell? That's life…
Hey…what's that? Looks like a key but it's stuck way down inside and
I wonder if there's some way to get this outta here.
If I just move this… And push that… Okay! I got it out!
Okay, there's gotta be a way to get it out.
Maybe if I move this a bit… and push that over… HAH! Gotcha!
Received "Beat-up Useless Old Key"!
Gather 'round, gather 'round, this is a bargain!! We've got the best armor and weapons, the likes of which you won't find anywhere else. But it's first come, first served, so get yours now!
Step right up! You there, don't just stand around outside. Go on in! Come on! Don't be shy, step right up!
I'll never know why he wanted to open a store in a dead town like this. What's with him? …sigh…
What's this?
The Lifestream is gushing up from below the surface of the earth!
Damn, that's… This is bad!!
CID!? What's wrong?
N, nothin'!! You and CLOUD get inside quick!!
But I…
Hey, don't worry about a thing. I ain't about to die that easily.
Be careful!
Okay, here I go! Watch this!!
Mideel Residence
You say you don't know when the stars are gonna fall from the sky? Is that for real?
I still don't believe it! How could this happen?
Ancient Weapon? End of the world? Malarky! I'm gonna live to be a hundred!
There's still tons of stuff I gotta do! This's just the beginning.
And what have Shinra and SOLDIER done about it? Tell me! They're useless!!
Actually, I'm a beautiful maid. I only work in this accessory store part-time.
Our goods compare with the best goods anywhere. So, how about one?
Thank you. Stop by again.
I gotta feelin' something bad's gonna happen. Is everything gonna be okay?
I'm all right. I've lived a long, full life.
But I'm worried about my son and his family living in that far-off town…
I hope they're safe…
Received "Elixir"!
Wait a minute.
Did you just take something?
Uh, oh. I'm…
Yeah, I took it, old man!
I know nothin' about it!
Hey, it's mine now! An' I'll make good use of it, believe-you-me!
Heh, heh. What an oddball. We'll let him use it.
Hey thanks. It'll help, pops!
Wh, wh-huh…? I don't know nuthin' about that.
What the hell happened to that rotten old elixir I was gonna throw out?
If someone took that by mistake it'll do more than make them sick…
Well, if you don't know then I guess you don't know.
…
Mideel Weapon Store
So that overgrown moon's gonna fall on us, huh?
This's no joke! We've got to start stocking up on supplies before they're all gone!
Outta the way! Hey, move it, move it!
You again! You aren't hoarding up goods too, are you?
Don't reach in front of me! Everything in this store is mine!
I've got money to burn! I've been saving like mad just for a time like this!
Oh…not much time left!! You never know when that moon's gonna come crashing down!!
When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things! If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!
Gotta buy!! Gotta buy, buy, buy!! I'm gonna shop till I drop!!
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! What can I get you today?
Thank you very much! Please come again.
Welcome to the charity store, a store of love and courage! Unfortunately, regarding the place you'd like to go…
The other customers have booked it all up… I'm afraid nothing's left.
…just kidding! Ha, hah, hah! Now how can I help you?
No good… I wonder if it's locked?
No good… Someone must've locked it.
Hmm…you really locked this one up good.
Damn, why the hell did they make something tricky like this?
…The key broke off inside, and I can't get to it…
… I don't know anything about it.
…The key broke off inside, and I can't get to it…
… I don't know a thing about it…
Oh yeah, shall I try that old beat up key?
Hey, I know what'll do it… Let's try that beat up old key!
Use the beat up old key!
Forget it
I'd better not. It doesn't look like it fits.
Naw, forget it… It doesn't even look like it fits.
Okay, this is it.
Yeah, this is it.
Hmm…Huh? This is pretty tight…
Huh? Wha? Won't turn…
Eyaaah!?
Wha?
Oh no! …it broke. Now I can't get it out…
Hoo, *&%$^% Busted it… Can't get the damn thing out…
Is something wrong?
Ulp!?
Ulp!!
Huh? Uh, no…
What am I gonna do?
Lie your butt off!
Tell them the truth!
Oh, uh, no, uh I…
Damn, this's bad…
What the hell…lie!
Just apologize and get it over with!
Nothing! I was just thinking how nice that door was, that's all.
Er, nothin'. Hah, hah. That's one nice door you got there, y'know.
Oh…why, thank you very much.
Whew…that was close. But I feel bad…
Phew…that was a close one. But I kinda feel a little bad about it.
I'm…sorry! I forced the key and it broke!
Mmm…sorry! I twisted the ^%$#^ and it broke.
Huh? Key? You mean the one to that door?
Hah, hah, hah! That's a good one!
???
Of course there's no key. It's a wall. We just painted a door on it.
What!? It's not a real door?
Say what? You drew that door on the wall?
That's right. We drew it on there to make it feel like you could pass through it to another world.
Sorry to have surprised you. It's not much of an apology, but please take this.
Really? Thank you.
TIFA and the others
received "Cursed Ring"!
Oh, uh…well Thanks.
CID and the others
We're hoping to pass through a door like that one into another world.
I feel that you all might be able to make my dreams come true. Weird, isn't it?
What is it? You're being awful friendly all of a sudden.
Oh, so that's it. You want the Mimmet Greens…don't you?
Give it some Mimmet Greens
Don't give it any
Sorry, little guy. I can't give you any.
Well, okay. Here, go ahead and eat.
hee hee…how cute! I just want to tickle him.
What's this!? You're bein' awful friendly.
Oh, so that's it. You want the Mimmet Greens…don't you?
Don't give it any.
Sorry, shorty. But I can't give ya any.
Well, guess there's no way around it. Here ya go, shrimp. Eat up.
Heh heh, hey he's kinda cute. Aw, maybe I'll just tickle him a little.
The chocobo looks like it enjoyed eating the Greens.
Tickle his feet
Tickle his stomach
Tickle his neck
Tickle his belly button
Tickle behind his ears
Tickle under his arms
The chocobo looks like it loves that.
The chocobo looks a little ticklish.
The chocobo looks a little angry.
The chocobo looks a little shy.
The chocobo looks bored.
Dined and dashed.
Received Materia from the Chocobo!
But you've got too much Materia
you can't take on anymore…
The chocobo put the Materia away.
Oh, you scared me…! I thought you were dead!
Sheesh, you scared me. I thought you croaked!!
Chocobos ignore humans who
don't look like they'll give them greens.

So that overgrown moon's gonna fall on us, huh?
When it all comes down to it, this world's about money and material things! If you got 'em, you can get by whenever, wherever!
Welcome! Cash is welcome here! How may I help you?
Thank you! Come again!
Welcome! We always welcome cash! Now, about where you want to go…
I'm afraid other customers have already booked it up. There's nothing left.
…just kidding! Just a little joke.
Mideel Materia Store
Welcome! We always welcome cash! Now‚about where you want to go…
I'm afraid other customers have already booked it up. There's nothing left.
…just kidding! Just a little joke. Now what can I do for you?
Mideel Clinic
Doctor
Hey! You barged in here like Meteor was crashing down or something.
I'm sorry…but I heard a friend of mine was here…
A friend?
Oh…that young fellow!?
Don't worry. He's next door. But his condition isn't good.
Here?
Over here.
CLOUD!?
Oh…CLOUD!! I'm so glad you're safe!?
Uh…aaa…?
Wh…what's wrong… CLOUD?
Aaa..gurk..
CLOUD! What happened to you?
Mako poisoning… Quite an advanced case.
It appears this young man's been exposed to high levels of Mako energy for an extended period of time.
He probably has no idea who or where he is now…
Poor fellow, he can't even speak. He's literally miles away from us.
Some place far away where no one's ever been… All alone…
Doctor!!
This's bad…
How horrible…
That's terrible…
Damn, that's evil.
You lyin' or what!?
Ahem! Let's excuse ourselves.
Listen, would you all mind… waiting outside?
Why? What do you want me to do?
Please, CLOUD… Talk to me…
Tell me you see me, that you can hear me… Tell me, please…
I made it this far believing in the memories we shared.
This isn't happening! It's too cruel!
Oh, CLOUD! I…
I don't care about anything else, only CLOUD…
I…want to be by his side…
Yeah, that's probably best…
For CLOUD… and you…
Yes, that's best!
Yeah. Right. Hang in there, TIFA.
Then you gotta do it. You gotta be true to yourself.
If TIFA were my nurse, I'd switch places with CLOUD any day!
Do what you wish.
I'm sorry, everyone… Especially now…
Why you apologizin'? We'll come back again an' check on ya.
You take care now, TIFA. And take care of CLOUD.
Don't worry. I'll stop by again.
You hang in there, TIFA. Take care of CLOUD.
That's all right. We'll be by again.
Do your best, TIFA. Take care of CLOUD.
No big, no big. I'll pop in again later.
Look after CLOUD. Take care, TIFA.
What're you talkin' about? We'll stop in again.
Hope CLOUD gets better soon.
Don't worry. We'll return and check on him later.
Take care of him.
Right…
Oh, and uh, TIFA… I don't like askin' this but…
Are you sure he's really your friend? And not Sephiroth's shadow?
Huh!? Well…that is…
No, I'm sure of it!
Yeah? OK, then… Sorry for askin'.
We gotta get back to the Highwind.
Now, we gotta be headin' back to the Highwind.
We should be getting back to the Highwind.
Hey, shouldn't we be gettin' back to the Highwind?
Well, I guess we'd better go back to the Highwind.
Very well then, we should return to the Highwind.
So what about him?
You know… CLOUD?
Listen Doc, why don't you tell us the truth.
What about CLOUD? Is he all right?
Tell me doctor, is CLOUD all right? I mean will he heal?
Hey Doc, is he okay? Is he gonna heal?
Hey doctor, is CLOUD all right? Is he gonna get better? Come on, tell us the truth
I'll say it again, he's got Mako poisoning. I've never seen a case this bad…
An immense amount of Mako-drenched knowledge was infused into his brain.
It's a miracle he survived! No normal human could have.
No wonder… After fallin' in the Lifestream an' bein' washed up here…
No wonder… After all, he fell into the Lifestream and was carried down here.
No wonder. He fell into the Lifestream and washed up here…
No lie. After fallin' head first into the Lifestream.
No wonder. After falling into the Lifestream…
But remember, the light of hope can be found anywhere.
If you give up hope… What will happen to him?
…hope…
Hey, but honestly, man… Do I really want him to come back?
What did he do for the world? What can he do for us from here on out? He may be nothing more than Sephiroth's shadow…
Is something wrong?
No, nothin'. Nothin' at all, Doc.
…Hope…
I guess that's all that's left now…
Hmm, I know he'll recover! CLOUD was a strong member of SOLDIER.
Yeah, that's right. Besides, WE'RE here for him. He's gotta get better!
Yeah! I know CLOUD'll get better!
With friends like us worrying about him He'll pull through.
You okay?
Are you all right, TIFA?
You okay, TIFA?
You all right?
Yes… I'm sorry to worry you all.
There's something I want to say to you…
Corel!
What else can they do to Corel!?
And the Huge Materia…
You mean the Huge Materia, don't you? I've heard about it.
When our small Materia nears the larger one, there should be some reaction.
I'm certain of it. That's why we're using the Materia power in our fight…
Can't let Shinra get a hold of the Huge Materia!
Besides, when CLOUD gets back, I wanna show him this Huge Materia. He's gonna be shocked.
So, what are you saying, BARRET?
Even though you're always knocking him, you really want CLOUD to return.
I ain't sayin' nothin' 'bout nothin'. So just…shut your face!
Every group's gotta have a leader.
An' that's me!
Or at least I wanna be… But I ain't cut out to be no leader.
I never knew that till lately.
That's what it is.
…ZZZZ…hmph?
Wha? What's goin' on?
You been chosen to be the new leader.
Pain in the ass. Forget it.
But for us to fight, we gotta have Highwind, and you.
We need it to save the Planet. An' who's runnin' this ship? You!
That's why you're our new leader. Ain't no one else can do it.
Hmm…this ship's gonna save the Planet, huh? Ain't that gonna be just a little tough?
Oh man, stab me in the heart.
I'm a man, too!
Okay, I'll do it! Everyone, follow me!
Alright, now here's the first job.
The Operation Room's waiting for you!
As soon as we're ready, we'll head for the Corel reactor.
Hurry, CID!
Pilot in training (LV5)
Eaggggghh! Congrats' on becoming our leader, Cap'n!
Yaaah! Are we taking off?
Eagggggh! We're taking off now!
Hey…
It's tough being the leader.
CLOUD did a great job. Sheesh…
Shall we go to Mideel to check on things?
I wonder how CLOUD's doing.
I wonder if TIFA needs a break…
I could look after him instead.
Well, let's see… What's a good place to head to?
Corel? Fort Condor?
Where shall we go next? Shall we head for the Corel reactor?
What's next? Shall we head for Fort Condor?
Pilot in training (LV6)
Yaah! Shall we take off?
Yaah! We're taking off!
What's that sad face for?
What? Does CLOUD always gotta be around? We did fine without him in the beginning…
Right? An' what happened to the tough girl I used to know? Where'd she go to?
Whenever I think of CLOUD, everything gets all jumbled up.
No matter how powerful Shinra or Hojo is, I can't believe they can create humans.
But because of them, we know that Meteor is heading towards us.
Y'know, even if I saw him, I don't have a damn idea what I'd do.
Yo, Leader-man! Get your pilot ass up here!
Leader-man? What's next!?
Yo, wanna see what TIFA and the gang are doing?
Cheer up, TIFA…
There appears to be a small island near the Lifestream……
They said the Lifestream sometimes suddenly gushes out at the Southern island.
I remember hearing about this from Seto when I was a child, but I don't remember much else…
I'm sorry…TIFA.
We'll do our best for CLOUD and you.
…And AERIS, too.
CID.
Let's visit CLOUD and TIFA from time to time.
I wonder how TIFA and CLOUD…are doing.
TIFA.
You saw him slapping Scarlet around?
Yeah, he did a good job, too. It felt good just watching.
Let's never forget that spirit, and give it our all!
TIFA, I'll give you info on Shinra.
Ask me if there's anything you don't understand.
Everything appears calm right now at Shinra.
So now's the time to look for CLOUD. I'm worried about him, too.
I wonder where CLOUD is. Or could he already be…
TIFA… Do you think it's a good idea for me to quit Shinra?
Oh, I'm sorry.
TIFA, there's no way I can quit right now…
CID, I'm expecting big things from you
CID, you're tired, huh?
I'd like to change places with you, but I'm in charge of information, so I can't. Sorry.
Hmmn, the Huge Materia is at Corel, Fort Condor, and…
I'm sure there was another place that had it. Where was that…?
Shinra's…stopped.
Now we've got to be careful. I know Heidegger and his gang are plotting something.
…So glad you're all right, TIFA.
Too much hope is the opposite of despair.
An overpowering love may consume you in the end.
CID…I wish I had your go-get-them attitude.
It appears my feelings vanished into thin air ever since my long slumber….
…Don't expect me to do anything other than fight beside you.
I have no words of comfort. Of course, I don't believe you're the type who needs the kindness from others…
You look really tired, maybe you're ready to give up being leader?
No use singing the blues, baby. The best thing to do is to keep movin'.
Whenever anyone talks to me, I get all nervous and mess things up!
Hey you! What the hell are you doin'!?
Good day, Captain!
All we have to do is just pilot. They don't have to talk to us.
Looks like you turned out to be the leader after all, Captain…
Pilot in Training (LV7)
Yaaah!  Shall we take off?
Man!  We're taking off!
