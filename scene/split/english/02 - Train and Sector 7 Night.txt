CLOUD never came.
CLOUD… Think he was killed?
No way!!
CLOUD…
Say, do you think CLOUD's… going to stay on and fight for AVALANCHE!?
How the hell would I know!? Do I look like a mind reader?
Hmph!! If y'all weren't such screw-ups…
[EMPTY LINE]
Hey, BARRET! What about our money?
Uh, nothin'…sorry.
CLOUD!!
Looks like I'm a little late.
You damn right, you're late!!
Come waltzin' in here makin' a big scene!
It's no big scene. Just what I always do.
(*^%!
Havin' everyone worried like that. You don't give a damn 'bout no one but yourself!
Hmm… You were worried about me?
Wha!?
That's comin' outta your share, hot shot! 
Wake up!
We're movin' out! Follow me!
Hey, CLOUD!! You were great back there!
Heh heh…CLOUD! We'll do even better next time.
Careful, I'll shut this.
Oh, CLOUD!! Your face is pitch-black…
There you go!
Say, thanks for helping me back there at the reactor!
Yeah…
That's OK
Quit thanking me
Don't mention it.
It bugs me when you thank me. It's just a part of my job.
But, I… I was just glad…
You're right. We're just partners.
It's not ready yet… Whoa!!
Shut-off the switch in this position.
We can escape from the train event…
Did it!!
4th failure
3rd failure
2nd failure
1st failure
Escaped
Last Train from Midgar
Inside Train
Look…you can see the surface now. This city don't have no day or night.
If that plate weren't there… we could see the sky.
A floating city… Pretty unsettling scenery.
Huh? Never expect ta hear that outta someone like you.
…You jus' full of surprises.
The upper world…a city on a plate…
It's 'cuz of that &^#$# 'pizza' that people underneath are sufferin'!
All the pollution from Mako energy above falls down on the world below.
And the city below is full of polluted air.
On top'a that, the Reactor keeps drainin' up all the energy.
Thanks to that, the land is dying.
Then why doesn't everyone move onto the Plate?
Dunno. Probably 'cuz they ain't got no money. Or, maybe…
'Cuz they love their land, no matter how polluted it gets.
I know… no one lives in the slums because they want to.
It's like this train. It can't run anywhere except where its rails take it.
Stop actin' like a damn kid. Siddown an' shu'up!
Hey, CLOUD. You want to look at this with me?
It's a map of the Midgar Rail System. Let's look at it together. I'll explain it to you.
To the Route Map Screen
I like this kinda stuff. Bombs and monitors…you know, flashy stuff.
I know!
Next time, I'll make one just for you.
Thanks anyway
Looking forward to it
Oh yeah, you might regret it. I'm the type who takes things personal.
Okay, then I'll put a little extra effort in and make it with a BANG.
We're almost there. After talking with you, I'm ready to try! I think you've lit my fuse!
Speak of the devil…
That light means that we're in the ID Security Check area.
…whisper…whisper… (When the lights go off, you never know what kind of creeps'll come out.)
…We're almost back now. What a relief.
This train hasn't switched to security mode yet.
I'm sure that will change by tomorrow.
…YAWN…that sure took its toll on me. I'm gonna sleep till we get to the station.
…snore…heebeebeeheebee…snore… (Don't act so damn big, BARRET…snooze…)
Someday AVALANCHE's gonna be famous …and me, too!
CLOUD!!
Don't ya think I got a bright future ahead of me?
What do you have in mind?
Don't hold your breath
All my life, I felt like nothin' but a sidekick.
But, after joinin' AVALANCHE and tryin' to save the Planet, I feel like I can do lots of things.
Oh man, that's pretty harsh. CLOUD. You really think I won't?
I'm seein' stars. This sucks. I hate the dark.
Last Train from Midgar
CLOUD! Look over here.
Okay, it's about to start.
This is a complete model of the city of Midgar.
It's about a 1/10000 scale.
The top plate is about 50 meters above ground.
A main pillar supports the plate in the center, and there are other support pillars built in each section…
[EMPTY LINE]
Psst…whisper…whisper… (The No. 1 Reactor we blew up was in the northern section.)
Then there's No. 2, No. 3 all the way up to the No. 8 Reactor.
The 8 Reactors provide Midgar with electricity.
Each town used to have a name, but no one in Midgar remembers them.
Instead of names, we refer to them by numbered sectors. That's how things turned out.
Phew, look what's next! Look!
This is the route this train is on.
The route spirals around the main pillar.
We should be coming around the center, right now.
Each checkpoint has an ID sensor device.
It checks the identities and backgrounds of each passenger on the train and is linked up to the central data bank at Shinra headquarters.
Whisper…whisper… (We definitely look suspicious, so we're using fake IDs.)
Sector 7 Station
Yo!! Get over here, all'ya!!
This mission was a success. But don't get lazy now.
The hard part's still to come! Don't y'all be scared of that explosion!
Cause the next one's gonna be bigger than that!
Meet back at the hideout!! Move out!
Yo, CLOUD! You lissen up!
Yo! What're ya doin' now?
uh, BARRET… We, uh…
We can't do it. We just can't do it.
Don't worry! Don't get all worried!
CLOUD! Let's make the mission work!
CLOUD? When this mission's over…
Why don't all of us take a long vacation. Maybe we could go to a hot springs somewhere?
I don't know…
Yeah… If I feel like it.
Alrighty then! It's a date!
You never know what lies ahead.
…how lovely.
I might just have to tempt you, then.
Yo, you all done flappin' your gums!?
Go! Get on that train!
CLOUD… Don't be so distant.
Everyone wants to be your friend. I'm sure…
Damn, man!! I'm here to fight!
Don't care 'bout bein' nobody's friend.
Let's go! Don't be late!
My husband never came back.
I wonder if something happened to him?
No, I'm sure his leave was just canceled.
I went to the station everyday.
Then, one day…
You used to see that kind of thing a lot during the war.
Please take AERIS somewhere safe.
That's the last thing she said before she died.
My husband never came back, and I had no child.
I think I must have been very lonesome.
So I took AERIS home with me.
I'm not letting you go tonight.
Wow!
Isn't there somewhere we could go to be alone?
There's only the train graveyard around here. And they say there's ghosts around too!
…damn.
Hey, come over here.
But people will…
Who cares?
But… There's a weirdo over there.
Say, you're pretty gutsy.
Why don't you go snoop somewhere else, Romeo?
I've had it!
Me too.
You know this is the first time we've ever agreed on something.
Yes…
Well then, shall we?
urggh…
…huff…wheez
When you've been a train man as long as I have, you see a lot of people and a lot of lives.
People meeting, parting, joy, sadness… After a while, it doesn't even get to you anymore.
I wonder how long it's been… There's an invisible rail between me and the passengers.
I could never live their lives. I'm just a train man plain and simple. It's easier that way.
That's not to say that the crossing gate of my heart doesn't hurt now and again.
Back during the war, I remember there was a lot of painful scenes then.
But, that's a story for another day…
First train leaves Midgar at 05:04am.
Morning. Dawn comes and things never change.
You be careful not to get hurt. Come on back again, hear?
ALL ABOARD! The train is about to depart.
I heard a rumor that the plate was going to fall, crushing this station, I've worked at so many years.
But I just can't bear to leave here.
Sector 7 Slums
Don't get all slaphappy just 'cause today's mission went well!!
Yo, CLOUD! Over here, now!
Sector 7 Mechanized Tower
All right!! You losers go on ahead!!
OK! Go on ahead.
Heh heh…
You wanna meet your little baby?
Little baby?
Out of my way!
Heh! Jus' calm down.
Can't have people suspectin' us.
Hey! Don't act like you don't know what I mean!
I'm tellin' you…
You! CLOUD!! Get off your slow-movin' ass!!
The hell're you doin', boy? The operation's already started!!
I'm not opening up. Go away!!
Oh &$#&@!! What the hell's wrong tonight!!
I thought that long blackout was strange.
They say a Mako Reactor was destroyed above.
I was jes sittin' here drinkin', watchin' the news by myself. n' all of a sudden I get kicked outta the &*%$ store. What's up with that!?
Woo…ah geez, I'm blitzed. I jes love them homemade cocktails. But they sure do creep up on ya.
Did you hear?
Don't care
No, what?
There's a news update. They say that there was a terrorist explosion up above, and that this time it was a Mako Reactor!!
You know what this means?
No, what?
Ya see, I keep on top of these things, an' if ya ask me…
if you knock out Midgar's power, then all of its computers and signals are going to be knocked out, too.
Financially there must've been about a billion gil worth of damage.
An' that ain't all!! A lotta innocent people got killed, too!
If the explosion had been in the middle of the night, that woulda been one thing. At least the people coulda gone in their sleep.
This Mako explosion has really sent Midgar into a fit.
Oh, well excuse ME!
Explosions! Explosions! Oh Man! AVALANCHE is so cool!
Hey!! Heh heh heh… Say, you're kinda cute. Cutie pie…
I wasn't even done with my drink. I didn't even pay my bill…
All's quiet!! Shh, I'm spying now!
OH!! There's something!! DANGER!!  ALERT!!
Did you hear?
Bout what?
Don't care
About that little girl named TIFA and that bar called '7th Heaven'.
I'm not only informed, I'm kinda nosey too. Anyhow, I got the scoop.
You wanna hear?
You bet!
That BARRET and three of his henchmen are like this sometimes.
Suddenly, they throw out a customer and start talking trash to him. It's strange, if you ask me. And that place always smells like gun powder.
It's dangerous, I tell you. They must be doing terrible things in there.
Oh really? Well, aren't you a cool one!
There's a TV in there, but my cheap aunt won't let me in the house. Look for yourself.
Now that you mention it, there used to be an outside TV monitor here in the slums.
But that BARRET, busted it up.
Shot it up with that weird machine gun hand of his. Blam, blam, blam.
I think it was when President Shinra was on.
He was on again this morning, too, you know.
TIFA better watch out for her TV. 
Hey!! Open up! C'mon baby!!
It's me! Johnny! Mom!!
SHHH!! Wait a minute!!
Johnny
I thought you were something a little better than this, but you're just a punk kid after all.
Just what the hell do you think you're doing with my little TIFA?
And now?
We're just friends.
What's it to you?
But TIFA doesn't think so.
Why does she ask you n' not me?
If TIFA's in trouble then I'LL help her.
But then I guess not. She's nothing to me.
Not those memories beneath the stars when we were kids or all the stuff we talked about.
About all I got is the sake that she poured me everyday I went to the bar.
Crap!
Hey! You! Don't think you can just walk outta here like that!
Shhi-! You busted a promise!! n' you made TIFA cry!!
Oh yeah!?
That may be but you ain't walkin' away from here!
Urgh! You made a promise, didn't ya!? n' don' you fergit that TIFA like an angel. An angel of this slum!
I'm leaving. Goin' faraway. But when I come back I'll be a better man! This is goodbye!
Hey! Childhood friend! You better take good care of TIFA!
Cause, I'll be back!! Don't make her cry, dammit!!
I'll be back, I say!! n' don' fergit it!
I hope he doesn't get hurt.
That worries me the most.
Ah…Johnny's gone. You look a little disappointed.
I don't like to say it myself but, I'm just a lonely guy when I'm not drinking.
Yesterday, everyone in town was peeking at the two of you from outside the bar.
TIFA's childhood friend. That's a good one!
Listen! If there isn't anyone to listen, what's the use of getting gossip on everyone!?
Yeah, and you Mr. I-don't-care!
I'll get a little more information that would pique even your interest. You wait and see!
H, hey!! Keep your mitts off of Marlene!!
Ahh! Now I ain't got no one to pick on!
When it comes down to it…I'm gutless. I'm still just a no-good kid.
We're closed today. Come back tomorrow.
Don't be taken in by the Shinra. Mako energy will not last forever. Mako is the life of the Planet and that life is finite. The end is coming. Saviors of the Planet:  AVALANCHE
What crappy handwriting. And look at all this graffiti!
7th Heaven
Papa!!
Marlene! Aren't you going to say anything to CLOUD?
Welcome home, CLOUD. Looks like everything went well.
Did you fight with BARRET?
Yeah
Not this time
I should have known.
He's always pushing people around, and you've always been in fights ever since you were little.
I was worried.
Hmm. You've grown up. When you were little you used to get into fights at the drop of a hat.
Enter name
Flowers? How nice…
You almost never see them here in the slums.
But…
A flower for me? Oh CLOUD, you shouldn't have…
…
Give it to TIFA
Give it to Marlene
Thank you, CLOUD. It smells wonderful.
Maybe I should fill the store with flowers.
Thudthudthud!!
Marlene
Papa, welcome home!
You all right, BARRET?
Great!!
Get in here, fools!! We're startin' the meetin'!!
Everyone is down below.
Yeah.
Huh? Where'd you get that flower?
CLOUD gave it to me.
Oh…
Did you thank him?
Thank you, CLOUD.
We'll take care of you.
CLOUD… come over here.
Sit down.
How about… …something to drink?
I don't feel like it
Give me something hard
OHH!!
I can make a drink just as good as anyone else.
Everyone says my drinks taste the best!
Just a minute. I'll make one for you.
You know, I'm relieved you made it back safely.
What's with you all of a sudden? That job wasn't even tough.
I guess not…
You were in SOLDIER.
Make sure you get your pay from BARRET.
Don't worry. Once I get that money, I'm outta here.
CLOUD. Are you feeling all right?
…Yeah… Why?
No reason. You just look a little tired I guess.
You'd better go down below.
AVALANCHE Hideout
Yo, CLOUD! There's somethin' I wanna ask ya.
Was there anyone from SOLDIER fighting us today?
None. I'm positive.
You sound pretty sure.
If there was anyone from SOLDIER you wouldn't be standing here now.
Don't go thinkin' you so bad jus' cuz you was in SOLDIER.
…
Yeah, you're strong.
Probably all them guys in SOLDIER are.
But don't forget that your skinny ass's workin' for AVALANCHE now! Don't get no ideas bout hangin' on to Shinra.
Stayin' with Shinra? You asked me a question and I answered it…that's all.
I'm going upstairs. I want to talk about my money.
Wait, CLOUD!
TIFA! Let him go!
Looks like he still misses the Shinra!
Shut up!
I don't care about neither Shinra nor SOLDIER!
But don't get me wrong!
I don't care about AVALANCHE or the Planet for that matter!
You think I'm a little too uptight?
No…
The next mission will be to blow up the Sector 5 Reactor.
CLOUD, you're great! Don't you ever get nervous?
Or are you like, impervious to feelings? Naw, that couldn't be it.
Well, that's OK. Don't worry about me. I don't look like it, but I'm a coward at heart.
…CLOUD.
You say you don't care, but you came to talk to me.
CLOUD… You just want friends.
Isn't that right?
Blow off
I really don't care
Yeah, well. You look kind of lonely to me.
If you ever got anything you want to get off your chest, you can always talk to me.
You're terrible. Real cold-blooded.
Oops…
Hey, look at the news… What a blast.
Think it was all because of my bomb? But all I really did was just make it like the computer told me.
Oh no! I must've made a miscalculation somewhere.
Hey, that was my first bomb. Makes me kinda proud.
Money…
Oh my. It must have been for a lot of it.
Sure! Well, what the hell? It's a verbal agreement. Now let me figure this out.
Oh stop it, CLOUD! Did you hear me?
President Shinra
…today the No.1 Reactor was bombed. The terrorist group AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for the bombing.
It is expected that AVALANCHE will continue its reign of terror.
But citizens of Midgar, there is no need to fear.
I have immediately mobilized SOLDIER to protect our citizenry against this senseless violence. Thank you and good night.
Papa, you're so great!
Shucks!! …money…
Straighten things up with everyone for me.
Save Point
Access the menu and select [SAVE] to save your game.
Listen, CLOUD. I'm asking you. Please join us.
Sorry TIFA…
The Planet is dying. Slowly but surely, it's dying.
Someone has to do something.
So let BARRET and his buddies do something about it. It's got nothin' to do with me.
You damn right we'll do something about it. N' you stay outta this TIFA!
The terrorist group called AVALANCHE has claimed responsibility for today's bombing of the No. 1 Mako Reactor. It is also predicted that they will continue with similar terrorist activities in the future.
Will you please come back? Ah, wait. Please wait.
The president of Shinra is going to read a statement.
The next time we'll be up against…SOLDIER.
CLOUD, then you'll help us?
A promise is a promise
But I still hate BARRET
I hate BARRET.
You came to tell me that?
He's not a bad person.
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Come on. Let's go below!
Good Morning! CLOUD!
Did you sleep well?
BARRET's snoring kept me up….
Next to you, who wouldn't?
…psst…
(keep it down, they'll hear you. BARRET's always edgy before an operation.)
I don't know what you mean.
I'm going this time.
Marlene, you watch the store while we're gone!
All right!! Good Luck.
Take care!
Sorry, CLOUD. Marlene seems a little shy.
Aaah!! Nothin' like that first drink after a job.
Hic!!
Why don't you have one too?
No
Yeah, why not?
Oh!! That's more like it!!
Even if you were with SOLDIER, you're still a rookie here. So you'd better listen to whatever I tell ya!
What!? You tellin' me you're too good to drink with me?
Don't act big-headed jus' because you were in SOLDIER!
Biggs
Hic!!
Oh… don't tell BARRET what I jus' said.
Oh, CLOUD!
TIFA really knows how to cook.  Mmm…
Anyway, let me tell you somethin'.
About what?
I'm not interested in your stories
TIFA always lets me taste her cooking.
And look at me now, I'm rolly-polly.
Don't know whether I should be happy or sad. But it's the good food and drinks that make this shop famous.
Oh well… forget it then.
Hey Wedge, you're getting all excited.
Stop making such a mess!
You know, CLOUD. BARRET says those things, but…
We're really unstable right now. If SOLDIER were to show up, they'd whoop us.
CLOUD, ya gotta help us. I'm really scared.
CLOUD…. It's painful.
Why is that?
What's goin' on? It's really shakin' a lot…
TIFA? Where?
…I'm going out…
Received BARRET's stash, 1500 gil!
So! You're really leaving!?
You're just going to walk right out ignoring your childhood friend!?
What?
How can you say that!
…Sorry
….You forgot the promise, too.
Promise?
So you DID forget.
Remember? CLOUD, it was seven years ago…
You remember now, don't you? Our promise?
Look, the well.
Do you remember?
Yeah…back then.
I thought you would never come, and I was getting a little cold.
Sorry I'm late.
You said you wanted to talk to me about something?
Come this Spring…I'm leaving town for Midgar.
All the boys are leaving town.
But I'm different from them. I'm not just going to find a job.
I want to join SOLDIER.
I'm going to be the best there is, just like Sephiroth!
Sephiroth… The Great Sephiroth?
I thought about Sephiroth all the time. Even in my sleep. My mom had given up on me.
I had no idea you were planning on that.
But, what about our promise?
Isn't it hard to join SOLDIER?
…I probably won't be able to come back to this town for a while.
…Huh?
If you make it, will you be in the newspapers?
I'll try.
Hey, let's make a promise.
Umm…if you get really famous and I'm ever in a bind…
you'll come save me, all right?
What?
If I'm ever in trouble, my hero will come and rescue me.
I want to experience that at least once.
Ha, ha, ha! What's that?
You're laughing at me!
Come on! Promise me!
All right…I promise.
I'm not a hero and I'm not famous. So I can't keep our promise.
But you got your childhood dream, didn't you? You joined SOLDIER.
So come on! You've got to keep your promise…
Wait a sec big-time SOLDIER!
This is my pay? Don't make me laugh.
What? Then you'll…
You got the next mission lined up? I'll do it for 3000.
What!?
It's OK, it's OK.
…psst…. (We're really hurting for help, right?)
Uh….ugh…. (That money's for Marlene's schoolin'….)
2000!
Our target's the Sector 5 Reactor. Head for the station first.
I'll fill you in on the train.
Yo, CLOUD.
Got a message from the old man at the weapon shop upstairs! Said he's got somethin' special so come and get it!
Yo! If you pull somethin' funny… you now what I'll do to ya, right?
Whoa, wait a damn minute. CLOUD!!
A promise is a promise! Here!!
I'm so glad everyone's safe.
Yo! CLOUD!
Before the next mission, I got somethin' I wanna ask you!
I, uh… I don't really know how to use Materia!
I'll give you that Materia we found. Just teach me how to use it!
…sigh…
OK, I'll explain it
You wouldn't understand
So this is what makes them guys in SOLDIER so great, huh!?
Ok. I'll ask Jessie again later. But you're in charge of the Materia!
&$*#! What's this, It wasn't that tough!' crap?
I don't get it!….
You just handle the Materia, CLOUD!
CLOUD! I got a message from the Weapon Shop man upstairs.
He has something he wants to give you. Don't forget!
[Materia System]
Access the menu and select [Materia] to equip Materia.
Sector 7 Item Store
Ahh… Another slow day…
If this keeps up, this store's goin' under…
Can't sell any really good medicine in a slum like this.
Oh!! Look at this! This doesn't happen everyday. Are you…a customer?
Yes!! Welcome!! We sell! We buy!
By the way, you wouldn't happen to be…
Naw, never mind. Forget it.
Sector 7 Weapon Shop
He, HEY! Waitaminit you!!
You can't just walk outta here without buyin' somethin'! Might be unhealthy fer ya, if ya know what I mean.
Hey!! What the--YOU!?
Anyone talking to me must be a novice.
Yep, that's me
I used to be in SOLDIER, the name's CLOUD
So what. Everyone's gotta start sometime.
The name's CLOUD. Used to be with SOLDIER, I got no business with you.
Hmmph!! Well, I never heard of ya!
Don't act so big, amateur. Seein' as how I'm such a warm hearted guy, I'll show ya the ropes.
You come back here tomorrow. I got some things I gots ta do.
Heh heh…He'll forget about it. OH, you!! Get my friend on the second floor to teach ya.
Crap!! Watch it, you old guy!
I was just about to rip up that smooth little head of yours!
In the slums ya gotta take care of yourself first. I been livin' like that ever since I was a kid.
You wanna be tough like me? Then you gotta pick out some good weapons.
Oh and uh, by the way old guy…
You can see this store don't have no customers… and even tough guys like me could use a buck or two…
Ya think you could spare some cash?
Give him some
Don't give him any
YESSS…
Damn, man!! Ya chinsey old %*&!
Hey old guy! I got a good-lookin' sister!!
What's the matter, old dude? You don't like women?
You dried up old geez. You tired?
Why don't you rest up on the third floor of my house?
There's just one condition.
You gotta give me some cash.
1 gil
10 gil
Damn, man!! Just forget about it!
Go ahead 'n' help yourself to the room.
Cheap %#*^…
Geez, dude, you're really old. You sure you ain't poorer than me?
Use whatever bed you want. Sleep tight, old guy.
Weapons Shop 3rd Floor
This is a slum, so don't think you can stay for free.
What are you going to do?
Doesn't just seeing the bed make you sleepy?
no way
Tough guy, huh!? You'd better sleep when you can.
You'd better save when you can.
That's the trick to being tough. Remember that, old dude.
Sweet dreams, pops.
Rough times, huh pop? Not a dime on you?
Hoo…
Sector 7 Slums, Weapons Shop Floor 2
Beginner's Hall
Unn!! Who the hell are you!? No unauthorized access.
Do you know about what's been going on?
What, that again?
…
You must be sick of hearing it… But it's been so long since there was any real news here.
You're worried where it's all heading, right? Everyone's in a buzz 'bout that terrorist group AVALANCHE blowin' up the Sector 1 Mako Reactor.
On the surface they say they're an anti-Shinra group, but in reality…
they say they're just out to kill as many people as they can.
Since today's special, I'm gonna let you in on a juicy bit of news. But you gotta keep it to yourself.
Haaa, haaa, haaa!!
That's a good one, ain't it!? While they're bustin' things up on top, the only ones makin' out good are us weapon stores!
Now, if we can just get rid of this back stock, we'll be doin' OK.
I welcome everything going to pot!
GO!! GO!! AVALANCHE!! That's what I say!
You know what I do? I'll bet you don't.
You come here tomorrow and I'll tell you.
Ahh, there just ain't no good jobs here in the slums.
I wanna go to the upper world.
This is the Beginner's Hall.
You say you're a beginner? But your eyes say you're not.
Don't mess with me. I used to be in SOLDIER. I'll tell you how much I know… an' for free too!
What do you want to know?
How to save?
How to heal your allies?
Curative Magic?
Weapons and armor?
How to apply Materia?
Effective ways to use Materia?
How to form your battle party?
How to check your status?
About Limit status?
Other things to watch for?
That's all
First, you need Potions.
You're a stingy one. Here, I'll give you ONE Potion.
I don't have any extra Potions on me. Why don't you go buy some?
Sorry. I'll have to go get my money.
You probably know all this. But just in case, I'll go over it.
Until you get instructions, don't open or take discs out of the CD drive.
After you open up the CD drive, I can't guarantee what'll happen. That's all.
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
Received "All" Materia!
Received "Ether"!
Hey!! You got one right off!
That was Materia. Next, take this [treasure chest]!
Now listen, hidden in these treasure chests are a lot of items.
There are box types and bag types, so make sure you don't overlook any.
This is the fabled [Save Point]!!
At a [Save Point] you can use a [tent] and/or select 'SAVE'.
You can also do something else there, but right now it's a secret.
Even if you are wiped out, if you've saved, you can restart from that same point. That way you don't have to worry when you've been wiped out.
This is jumping ahead a little but, when you leave Midgar…
and you get to the world map, you can save anywhere you like. Remember that.
That should be all you need to know about the Save Point. I'll probably see you again somewhere down the road. Take care!
I'm a [treasure chest]!!
Beginners, make sure and keep an eye out for me!!
Hey SOLDIER!! Tell us about battles! We'll even pay you!

About [Change] and [Defend]
About [Escape]
About [Gauges]
About [Status]

About [Help]
That's all the time I have for you!
I'm not hard up enough to take money from guys like you. But I'll rap with you for a while.
ATB or Active Time Battle is a system that is always in operation during battle.
Select [Wait] from ATB on the Config Menu and time will stop when you select magic or items during battle.
This gives you time to pick out your commands. This is especially helpful to beginners.
Selecting [Recommended] ATB in the config menu can stop time while the effects of spells and items are taking place during battle.
This lets you take your time looking over the progression of the battle. When you don't want to rush in battle, this is for you!
Personally, I always use [Active], but you can use whichever you like.
White numbers appearing on the screen in battle are damage points. Green numbers show restorative points.
You better watch these if you don't want to get wiped out.
The [Change] command can move characters to and from the front and back rows.
In the back row, the damage received is less, but the attacking power is less.
You can make a [Change] by pressing the Directional button in battle.
Pushing the Directional button the other direction during battle accesses [Defend].
Selecting [Defend] reduces the damage you receive by half until the next command.
If you're up against a strong enemy, don't hesitate to use this one. Of course, I never need it.
I don't really remember ever having to use the [Escape] command… but you'll probably need it.
Push [PAGEUP] and [PAGEDOWN] together, hold them down, and you can escape.
During battle, there are several [Gauges] displayed. You can't check them now, so just remember what I tell you.
[time gauge] displays the time remaining until your next turn while in battle.
When the gauge is full, you can make your command. If you don't want to make one, push [MENU] and you can move to the next character. It's convenient when you wanna make BARRET work.
The [limit gauge] increases every time you sustain damage. When it is full, you can use the [limit technique].
This gauge is not cleared after each battle, but gradually builds up over time.
It takes a while for it to build up, so you have to think about which times are the best to use it.
You probably don't know about them, but there are conditions of [fury] and [sadness].
When you have [fury], your limit gauge builds up sooner, but your attacking accuracy is lower.
Keep in mind that [sadness] makes your limit gauge build up slower, but the damage you receive is also lessened.
The [barrier gauge] shows your defense barriers.
The top gauge displays [barrier] or magic defense against attacks. The bottom gauge displays [magic barrier] or defenses against magic attacks.
Both will cut the damage you receive in half. However, over time they will disappear.
Whenever you use [barrier] or [magic barrier] make sure to pay attention to the [barrier gauge].
That's it. Remember that for the next battle.
Looks like you didn't get it the last time I told you. What's wrong with you? You touched in the head?
Well, don't worry. You just need to push [ASSIST] in battle.
Do that, and the [Help] message will walk you through the commands.
It also shows you the name of your enemy, so even I use it once in a while. Make good use of it.
[wiped out]. This is one I've never personally used. But I heard from someone what it was about.
When you are wiped out, you start back from the last save point.
Even a weakling like you can make it out of the roughest places as long as you hang in there and fight. You should be glad!
[Status] means just that. The status of each character.
I'll probably wind up repeating myself, but let me go over a few basic points.
Sleep You cannot put in a command until you get up.
Poison Steals your HP in battle.
Fury Damage is increased, attack accuracy decreased. Tranquilizers will remedy it.
Sadness Damage is decreased. Hyper will remedy it.
Petrify Will petrify and become immobilized. Every member will be wiped out.
Confuse Will attack enemy and ally alike.
Silence Will be unable to cast magic.
Paralyze Stops time gauges, commands.
Darkness Accuracy of hitting attacks decreases.
Frog Become a frog. I hate this one!
Hoo…I'm beat.
Your [Status] can be changed with magic and items, so you should check it whenever you buy things.
[elemental] is the special effect that comes with certain weapons and magic.
It's necessary to move ahead effectively. If you pay attention to the types of elementals you use you'll become intermediate in no time.
I put together this list, but remember, it's just a partial list don't take it too literally.
Fire Fire effect. Works best on animals and water monsters.
Ice Ice effect. Works best on fire monsters and things that hate the cold.
Lightning Lightning effect. Works best on mechanical things.
Earth Attacks using the earth's power. Doesn't work on flying enemies.
Poison Poisons enemies. Doesn't work on any poison-based enemies.
Gravity Gravity-based attack. These hurt if they hit.
Water Calls on the earth's water. Works well on fire monsters.
Wind Calls up the winds. Works well on flying enemies.
Holy Calls up the Planet's power. Works well on dark monsters.
If you use reciprocal elementals in your attacks, the effect is huge!
Also, if you use the same elemental, your defenses are raised. But, you have to be careful because the opposite is also true.
To see what elementals an enemy has, you need [Sense] Materia. If you get that Materia, you should try using it.
……smack……knock……!!
Help!
You've got to hang in there. Your limit gauge is just starting to build.
Waaaah!!
OK! Now your limit gauge is full, go ahead and use it! Fight with your limit technique.
Magic!! Magic!!
Calm down! When your enemy uses magic counter with [Magic Barrier] or [reflect].
[Magic Barrier] reduces the damage received from magic by half.
[reflect] bounces the attacks off you. But the number of times you can use it is limited so be careful.
Wow! You sure are strong! I'm going to be strong, too !
Me too!
If you want to get as strong as me you need to use Materia. And you have to find the best combinations of them.
The type of Materia you put in your weapons and armor will determine how quickly your Materia grows.
Put Materia into the open slots in your weapons and armor. The possible combinations are limitless.
That's about all I can tell you. If you want to be like me, you have to have some natural talent.
I still don't get it!
Listen kids, don't piss me off!
That's all right. Just give it a try. Little by little, you'll get used to it.
Great!
How to use the buttons.
[Directional button][CONTROL]
up [MENU]: menu
leftright: walk  [OK]: speak/execute
down [CANCEL]: run
[PAGEUP]/[PAGEDOWN]: turn.
Huh? Finger!? What the hell?
I'm the position cursor!! Call me whenever you're walking around confused!
Push [ASSIST] and I'll appear over your shiny little head.
Geez, you stand out even more than I do…
Am I in the way? If so, just push [ASSIST] one more time.
I'm pretty busy myself, and can't always come when you need me. If I don't show up sometimes, don't get mad.
Later!
[Position Cursor]
Push [ASSIST] when you're lost in the field. Usually, the [Position Cursor] will appear on the screen.
But wait!!
[Red triangles] mark the exits and [Green triangles] mark ladders.
These will help you safely make it through even the darkest streets or dangerous mountains! But, there are times when they won't appear, so be careful.
Johnny's Home
Ha, Ha!…… Well, there's nothin' wrong with that, I'd say.
Ha!  Ha!…… I wonder if my son's already left?
When it's just my wife and I here, you have no idea how lonesome it gets.
We want him to be happy and do other things while he's young, but we can't help but worry…
I guess we always will.
By the way……
Where are you from?
A village called Nibelheim
Who cares?
But if you still have a family, you outta at least write them.
You may leave your home, but it'll always be there for you.
At least that's how I see it.
Hmm…did you say Nibelheim? Wasn't it in the news a while back?
Something to do with a reactor accident…
That was the first major Mako accident, I remember it was all over the news.
This might sound rude, but…
Is your family still living?
I forgot about them long ago
I'm just an ex-SOLDIER
Well, you really outta go home again. And if you can't do that, try and at least remember them sometimes.
Our boy acted like you, When he was a kid.
You seem to be about his age.
Well, would you mind leaving us alone?
I want to enjoy some quiet time together with my wife.
He used to give us nothing but headaches when he was here, but now that he's gone…we kind of miss him. …Strange, isn't it?
