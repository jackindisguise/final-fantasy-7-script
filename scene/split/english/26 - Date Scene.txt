But you're different.
AERIS
Things are different…

There ain't no way I'm lettin' a wacko like you anywhere near my little Marlene!
BARRET
She's my baby. My prized possession.
BARRET

BARRET
Wish I could've brought Marlene here. She'd love the fireworks.
BARRET
Why the hell do I gotta be here with a jackass like you!

Sorry it's out of order.
Yaaay!!
Yaay Yaay!
Come on now‚no running.
CAIT SITH
Hey! Look here! The Key Materia!
Tseng
Well done.
CLOUD
Hey!
CAIT SITH
W, w, wait a second. I won't run or hide.
Yes‚I was a spy. I was hired by the Shinra.
TIFA
Don't mess with us!
AERIS
…I trusted you. I can't believe you!
BARRET
Ya dirty &*$*%$!
CLOUD
You think this's a big joke!?
CAIT SITH
I can't help it. What's done is done. That's just the way it is.
How 'bout if we go on like nothing ever happened?
CLOUD
You're pushin' it‚CAIT SITH! You gotta lot of nerve staying with us all the while being a spy!
CAIT SITH
Then‚what are you goin' to do? Destroy me?
CAIT SITH
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.
TIFA
So you're from Shinra. Who are you?
AERIS
So you're from Shinra. Who? Who are you! Tell me!
BARRET
Who the hell are ya!? What's your real name!?
YUFFIE
Part of the Shinra! Who the *&$# are you!?
CAIT SITH
Whoa‚I can't tell you my name.
CLOUD
We're not gettin' anywhere.
CAIT SITH
Right? I told you! Talking won't do any good‚so can't we just continue our journey?
CAIT SITH
…Alright‚yes‚I am a Shinra employee.
But we're not completely enemies.
CAIT SITH
…Something bothers me. I think it's you're ways of living
You don't get paid You don't get praised. And yet you still risk your lives and continue on your journey. Seeing that makes me…
CAIT SITH
It just makes me think about my life. I don't think I'd feel too good if things ended the way it is now.
TIFA
You're lying again.
AERIS
…And so on‚and so on…
BARRET
Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
YUFFIE
Sounds fishy---
CLOUD
He won't come clean. And he won't quit being a spy.
We can't go on with someone like that. Pull your head out!
CAIT SITH
…I thought so. It won't do any good talking to you.
So‚I've prepared myself in case something like this happened.
CAIT SITH
Why don't you listen to this.
Dad! TIFA!
TIFA
Marlene!
AERIS
Hey! That's Marlene!
BARRET
Ma…Marlene!?
CLOUD
…Marlene?
Marlene
Hey! It's dad! Dad! It's me‚Marlene!
Marlene
Hey! It's TIFA! TIFA! You know what!
Marlene
Hey! It's the flower lady! Flower lady…
Marlene
Hey! It's CLOUD!
CAIT SITH
…So‚there's no other way but to listen to me.
CLOUD
You're the lowest…
CAIT SITH
I didn't want to do this either. Not by using dirty tricks and taking hostages…
CAIT SITH
So‚this is how it is. There's no room for compromises. So why don't we go on as we did.
CAIT SITH
Tomorrow is the Temple of the Ancients‚right? I know where it is so I'll tell you later.
Of course we'll get there after the Shinra‚ but you'll have to deal with that.
CLOUD
…Well‚we're stuck… We'll have to do what he says.
TIFA
…Marlene.
AERIS
I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to Mom?
BARRET
Sorry‚CLOUD.
YUFFIE
Uh‚yup.

You think I'm jokin'!?
CAIT SITH
I couldn't help it.
How 'bout if we go on like nothing ever happened?
CLOUD
No way, cat! You gotta lot of guts acting like a friend but being a spy!
CAIT SITH
Then, what are you goin' to do? Kill me?
CAIT SITH
You'd just be wastin' your time if you tried. This body's just a toy anyway.
My real body's at Shinra Headquarters in Midgar. I'm controlin' this toy cat from there.
TIFA
So you're from Shinra. Who are you?

BARRET
Hmph! You ain't foolin' us this time!
YUFFIE
Sounds fishy…
CLOUD
He'll never tell the truth. Once a spy, always a spy.
We can't go on with someone like that. C'mon get real!!
CAIT SITH
…just as I thought. Talking won't make a bit of difference.
But I prepared something in case this happened.
CAIT SITH
Why don't you listen to this?
Papa! TIFA!
TIFA
Marlene!
AERIS
Hey! That's Marlene!
BARRET
Ma…Marlene!?

Marlene
Hey! It's CLOUD!
CAIT SITH
…So, you have to do as I say.
CLOUD
You're the lowest…
CAIT SITH
I didn't want to do this… using dirty tricks and taking hostages…
CAIT SITH
But this is how it is…no compromises. So why don't we go on as we did?

Of course,we'll get there after the Shinra, but you'll have to deal with that.
CAIT SITH
Oh, you didn't seem to know this, but…
The Keystone is the key to the Temple of the Ancients. Even so, you're all going, right?
I know where it is, so I'll show you later.
The Shinra have already been there, but I guess you have to deal with that.
CLOUD
…Well, we're stuck… We'll have to do what he says.
TIFA
…Marlene.
AERIS
I wonder if Marlene is all right… I wonder what happened to Mom?
BARRET
Sorry, CLOUD.
