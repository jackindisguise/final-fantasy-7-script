…You all right?
…Can you hear me?
…Yeah…
Back then… I only got scraped knees…
…What do you mean by 'back then'?
What about now?
Can you get up?
…What do you mean by 'back then'?”
…What about now?
…Don't worry about me. Worry about yourself now.
…I'll try.
…How about that?
Take it slow now. Little by little……
…I know.
Hey…who are you?
Oh! It moved!
Whew… What relief.
Hello, hello?
Hello, hello!
You okay?
You just fell from above. You really gave me a scare.
This is a church in the Sector 5 slums.
…I came crashing down?
The roof and the flower bed must have broken your fall. You're lucky.
Flower bed…is this yours?
Sorry about that.
That's all right. The flowers here are quite resilient because this is a sacred place.
They say grass and flowers won't grow in Midgar.
But for some reason, they have no trouble blooming here.
I love it here.
So, we meet again.
Don't you remember me?
Yeah, I remember…
Never saw you before
Yeah, I remember…
You were selling flowers
You're the slum drunk
Oh! I'm so happy!
Excuse me, but you're really rude!
…I guess you don't remember. You were walking in a daze.
Thanks for buying my flowers.
You didn't buy any flowers from me though.
But I forgive you, because you bought flowers from me.
I don't remember a thing.
Well, that's okay.
Say, do you have any Materia?
Yes, some.
Nowadays you can find Materia anywhere.
But mine is special. It's good for absolutely nothing.
…good for nothing? You just don't know how to use it.
No, I do… it just doesn't do anything.
I feel safe just having it. It was my mother's.
Say, I feel like talking. Do you feel up to it?
After all, here we are meeting again.
I don't mind
Got nothing to talk about
Wait here. I've got to check my flowers. It'll just be a minute.
…Oh, I see.
Ahhh. I wonder whose fault that is. It's not easy to grow them, you know. Poor flowers.
Just a little longer.
Oh!
Now that you mention it…
We don't know each other's names, do we?
My name is…
I'm AERIS‚the flower girl. Nice to meet you.
I'm AERIS, the flower girl. Nice to meet you.
The name's CLOUD.
Me? I do a little bit of everything.
Oh…a jack of all trades.
Yeah, I do whatever's needed.
What's so funny? What are you laughing at?
Sorry, I just…
Huh?
CLOUD! Don't let it get to you!
Sorry, bad timing on my part.
Say, CLOUD. Have you ever been a bodyguard?
What's that?
You CAN do anything, right?
Yeah, that's right.
Then, get me out of here. Take me home.
OK… but it'll cost you.
OK then, let's see…
How about if I go out with you once?
Don't mind me.
I'll give you a little more time.
I don't know who you are, but…
You don't know me…
…I know you.
Oh yeah…I know you.
That uniform…
…Hey sis, this one's a little weird.
Shut up! Shinra spy!
Reno! Want him taken out?
Reno
I haven't decided yet.
CLOUD, don't! Stop!
Don't fight here! You'll ruin the flowers!
CLOUD! Over here!
The exit is back there.
Reno
Did you see that guy's eyes?
Reno
They were…Mako eyes.
Reno
Hmm. All right, c'mon, get to work.
Reno
They were…Mako eyes.
Reno
Yeah, all right. C'mon, get to work.
Reno
Oh!
Reno
And don't step on the flowers…
You just stepped on them yourself!
They're ruined!
You're gonna catch holy hell!
Inside the Church
Church Roof
Here's a barrel.
If I can just push it over…
Here's a barrel.
If I can just push it over…
Push the barrel?
Yes
No
Reno
There they are, over there!
CLOUD…that one!
I know. Looks like they aren't going to let us go.
What should we do?
Well we can't let them catch us, can we? Then, there's only one thing left.
AERIS! This way!
All right. I'll hold them off.
Right. Make sure they don't get through!
Reno
The Ancient is getting away! Attack! Attack! > Attack!
Reno
Think we killed 'em? They never should've fought us!
Eaygh!!
AERIS!
CLOUD, help!
AERIS!
Hold on a minute!
Fight 'em!
RUN!
A, all right.
Guuagh!
Urkkk!
Nwahh!
Thanks, CLOUD.
Oh, CLOUD what are you doing!?
The Ancient! We got her!
Whew, that surprised me.
AERIS, this way.
CLOUD, hurry.
Damn!
What's that?
We'll get out through the hole in the roof.
Jump off that beam, and we should be able to make it through to the roof.
Church
Ha, ha… They're looking for me again.
You mean it's not the first time they've been after you?
…no.
They're the Turks.
Hmm…
The Turks are a Shinra organization. They scout for possible candidates for SOLDIER.
This violently? I thought they were kidnapping someone.
They're also involved in a lot of other dirty stuff on the side.
Spying, murder…you know.
They look like it.
But, why're they after you? There must be a reason, right?
No, not really. I think they believe I have what it takes to be in SOLDIER!
Maybe you do. You want to join?
I don't know… But I don't want to get caught by THOSE people!
Then, let's go!
Sector 5 Slum
…
Wait… Wait, I said!
Puff… …wheeze…
Slow…down… Don't leave me…
Funny…
I thought you were cut out to be in SOLDIER.
Oh! You're terrible!
Hey…CLOUD. Were you…ever in SOLDIER?
…I used to be. How did you guess?
…Your eyes. They have a strange glow…
That's the sign of those who have been infused with Mako… A mark of SOLDIER.
But, how did you know about that?
…Oh, nothing.
Nothing?
Right, nothing!
Come on, let's go! Bodyguard!

Sector 5 Slum
Whew! Finally made it off! Now what?
My house is over here. Hurry before they come.
The Sector 5 and Sector 6 slums are right ahead…
Do you know what kind of place they are? Tell me about sector 5 Tell me about sector 6
Yeah, I know
Sector 5 slum… It's not a big town.
No thrills, no danger. But there are a few stores so if there's something you want, stop by.
Sector 6 slum…heh heh heh, A man's paradise. I've always wanted to go.
…But not for a nice girl like you… But there may be something else good for you. Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, but it's a little dangerous over there, you know.
That's all I got to say. If you want to know more, you'll have to go there yourself. But you can't just waltz over there anytime you feel like it.
Hmm… Then, I'll do as I please.
HEY! Looks like they were in Sector 6. Have fun?
That reminds me, you don't hear much about Corneo lately. Wonder what happened to him?
I saw her! I really did!
This woman just disappeared! Right there around the old church.
I waited around a long time, but she never came out again!
I tell you, it's one of them …haunted churches! Ohhh…shiver…shake…
Then with a big rumble, the sector 7 plate came crashing down on the slum.
Oh man, if something like that ever fell on us…ohhh…shiver…
A really weird guy lives inside of some Huge Materia! And then there were 9 little devils! Ohh…shiver…shake…
Huh? Oh, uh, no, I uh… really didn't see it myself…I uh, well, it was more like a, whaddya call…rumor I heard.
All right. It was a lie. I just made it up because nothing's been happening around here lately.
You mean that's…

Sector 5 Slum
This guy are sick.
He passed out nearby and someone must have helped him here.
That guy in the pipe's a weird one. No matter what you ask him, he only answers 'uuh' or 'aahh'.
Earthen Pipe
ooh…aaah…ughhhh…
This is the one… won't you help him?
Listen, I'm no doctor.
No, I guess not…
Hey…that man has a tattoo. I think it's the number 2.
Received "Elixir"!
Even with all that commotion, you went on like nothing happened. You must've really been through the mill to get like that.
I don't know, they might even be better off this way.
Even though they know the planet is on its last legs, there's nothing they can do about it.
I wish I could close myself off like that.
These folks went wobbling off somewhere…
They said something about the Reunion starting'… sounded almost like a chant. Wonder what the heck that meant.
…sniff…sniff…
First there was a rumbling… …then cracking… and then ker-blaMM!!…
…I was so scared…sniff…
Outta the way! Move! You want something? Move into the store!
You finally think you're making a living in the pits of Midgar, and then a big piece of scrap like that falls down here…what's next?
Yeah, that's right! But even so, where could we move to now?
You ever hear of Wall Market?
Yeah
Nope
It's a market in the slums of Sector 6. They've got everything you could ever want there.
Oh yeah? Then maybe I should have you pick something up for me next time you're there…
What's going on with the world? When it's all said and done, we're all gonna wind up dead.
You've been talking like that for sometime now.
What am I doing? I'm walking around looking at the ground.
You find a lot of things people dropped when you look down. You never find them when you're looking up. Right?
Never thought that would come tumbling down. Maybe I better walk around looking up from now on.
I'm not going to look up or down! From now on I'm just going to look straight ahead.
Maybe not. I'm just flapping my gums. I really wonder how things will turn out.
Item Store
Hmmm,… …hmph…we only trade items for gil here.
Hmmm,… …hmph…we only trade items for gil here. No matter what.
Materia store
I don't care if it's scrap metal or Materia. We can get anything here in the slums.
Got a lot of good Materia here. Why don't you look it over?
You could live several lives in a place like this, and it still wouldn't be enough!
Well, how about some Materia? I gotta make some money and get out of here!
And I just got together enough money to get out of this place…
Now it doesn't matter where I go!
Hey!
Hey, didn't your mother ever teach you not to barge into houses and open up people's freezers?
Weapon Store
Taking care of yourself is the law of the slums. But to do that, first you need weapons, right?
You never know what's going to happen in this crazy world.
So you'd better have a weapon you can depend on! Am I right?
I don't know crap about crap! But I do know one thing. People are always gonna need a good strong weapon!
Huh? You want weapons? That's too damn bad…
I ain't got no weapons to sell ya! And the reason is…
…the weapon store's over that way.
…sure is loud outside. Wonder what's happening.
Toot toot! Next stop…Midgar Midgar.
Any passengers getting off at Midgar should please ring.
You know, Midgar's supposed to be sparkly 'n' springy 'n' sleeky.
Oh yeah. Someday, I'm goin' there.
Meteor's getting closer. You can hear it rumbling.
We don't do something about it and pretty soon it'll be…ker-blam!
House 1f.
Uh, test, test… This is a dummy message. A test. Is it coming through?
Hmph……! Everything President Shinra says is a lie.
But you can't trust that AVALANCHE, or whatever you call them.
You can bat it around all you like, but it all comes down to wanting to live like the people up there.
So who do I believe in? Myself! Me! I never lie to myself, that's for sure!
I believe only what I say. Because I never lie to myself.
And what's with the new president of Shinra, Inc.?
Hell, even the old president was better than him.
The hell's up with that!? I don't care if they're AVALANCHE or Avant-garde or whatever. Anyone who'd bring the plates down on us is nuts!!
SOLDIER? What about them!?
Damn! If they're really from SOLDIER, they should be doing something about all this!!
Me and my woman were going for a drive. Or at least we were supposed to until I had engine trouble and our plans fizzled.
Have you ever had that happen? I hate it when that happens!
A new standard in engines… the 'Shinra V-3000'. For the best drive of your car's life!
And now for the news.
A terrorist attack by the group called AVALANCHE has parts of Midgar temporarily out of power, but they will be restored momentarily.
Following President Shinra's address, Mayor Domino also spoke out today against AVALANCHE.
Now for the weather.
Tomorrow's weather will be overcast most of the day, with a slight chance of showers in parts of the city.
The cause of the accident is still unclear at this time, however, according to some sources it is believed to have something to do with the terrorist group, AVALANCHE.
Citizens, unite! Come to the light, Mako energy.
Power is Truth Shinra is the future. Real happiness can be found in obedience to the company!

Um, we're, um taking care of the um, flowers for the um, lady here.
…is that OK?
I don't mind
No it's not!
Take good care of them.
That's too much to ask of kids.
Too much to ask?  What? I don't get it.
CLOUD, what are you saying!?
Will you take good care of my flowers, for me?
Yeah!
Sure!
They're purrty!
I'm gonna water them later…
Hey! Where's the flower lady?
church in the slums
I'm home, Mom.
Yeah.
This is CLOUD. My bodyguard.
Elmyra
Bodyguard? You were followed again!?
Elmyra
Are you all right!? You're not hurt, are you!?
I'm all right. I had CLOUD with me.
Elmyra
Thank you, CLOUD.
So what are you going to do now?
…Is Sector 7 far from here? I want to go to TIFA's bar.
Is TIFA…a girl?
Yeah.
A girl…friend?
Girlfriend?
No way!
Yeah, that's right
Hee hee hee…
You don't have to get THAT upset…
Oh, how nice.
Well, that's…nice.
Let's see, Sector 7? I'll show you the way.
You gotta be kidding. Why do you want to put yourself in danger again?
I'm used to it.
Used to it!?
Well, I don't know… getting help from a girl…
A girl!! What do you mean by that!?
You expect me to just sit by quietly after hearing you say something like that!?
Mom! I'm taking CLOUD to Sector 7. I'll be back in a while.
Elmyra
But dear…I give up. You never listen once you've made up your mind.
Elmyra
But if you must go, why don't you go tomorrow? It's getting late now.
Yeah, you're right, Mom.
Elmyra
AERIS, please go make the bed.
You need to go through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. Sector 6 is a little dangerous so you'd better get some rest tonight.
CLOUD…
Good night.
Oh, man…
CLOUD's House
…seem pretty tired…
…!?
I haven't slept in a bed like this …for a long time.
Oh, yeah.
Ever since then.
My, how you've grown.
I'll bet the girls never leave you alone.
…Not really.
…I'm worried about you.
There are a lot of temptations in the city…
I'd feel a lot better if you just settled down with a nice girlfriend.
…I'm all right.
You should have…
an older girlfriend, one that'll take care of you.
I think that would be best for you.
I'm not interested.
…I must've fallen asleep.
Sector 7's past Sector 6… I should be all right by myself…
CLOUD! I thought the Turks came back! Get some rest!
Can't get caught this time…
Elmyra
That glow in your eyes… you're from SOLDIER, right?
Yeah. Or, I used to be…
Elmyra
… I don't know how to say this, but…
could you please leave here tonight, without telling AERIS?
Elmyra
SOLDIER…the last thing AERIS needs is to get hurt again.
Through Sector 6 to get to Sector 7. I should be able to do it alone…

You have to go through the slum in Sector 6 to get to TIFA's 7th Heaven.
I'll take you there. Come on!
Huh? Who the hell're you? Who do ya think you're talkin' to!?
Aaaaah…what a drag. You wanna go to that store in Sector 6 again?
The gate to Sector 7's in there.
Thanks. I guess this is goodbye. You gonna be all right going home?
Oh no! What ever will I do!?' …Isn't that what you want me to say?
Take her home.
Go on to Sector 7.
Isn't that a little out of the way?
Yeah, I guess so.
I could do that. But won't I be in your way?
What do you mean in the way?
Nothing!
Can we take a break?
I can't believe it's still here.
CLOUD, over here!
What rank were you?
Rank?
You know, in SOLDIER.
Oh, I was…
First Class.
Just the same as him.
The same as who?
My first boyfriend.
Were you…serious?
No. But I liked him for a while.
I probably knew him. What was his name?
It doesn't really matter.
Sector 7's just past this gate.
Okay, I guess I'll be going home now. I'm glad I met you, CLOUD.
Thanks for all your help.
Huh? Hey, back there…
TIFA!?
