Crater
An old crater…
Something fell out of the sky and crashed down here…
Leaving a scar on the Planet.
Sephiroth took that energy and is trying to use Meteor.
Next time the wound won't be so small.
So all this energy's gathered here for the Planet to heal itself?
So the Planet has gathered all this energy here to heal itself?
The energy of the Planet is concentrated here.
It is slowly healing its old wound.
Even I know what's going on. The energy's bein' gathered here to heal the gash.
Damn, this's somethin'. It's gathered all that energy to try an' heal itself.
It's trying to heal its wound by gathering all that energy here.
It's amassed a vast amount of energy to heal itself.

OK, let's go…
The rest is up to you!
CLOUD, wait for me!!
Please take me with you. You're going after Sephiroth, aren't you?
I've lost a lot because of Sephiroth too. So please take me along.
Don't say no. OK?
You're going after Sephiroth, aren't you?
I've lost a lot because of Sephiroth.
Let's go!
I'm going to call everyone.
Man, I sure am thankful. Wanna rest a while?
Are you saying you don't like me?
I'll gather everybody, so you go on ahead.
Keep on your guard… Sephiroth may be near.
Whirlwind Maze
That's…!!!
Rufus is coming here, too?
Received "Neo Bahamut" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia. Please discard some Materia.
Rufus
So, I finally found you.
Scarlet
Kyaa haa hah.
Scarlet
Kyaa haa hah.
haa hah
haa…hah
This is incredible…
Heidegger
This is the Promised Land the President had been searching for!!
Rufus
But, I'll be the one who gets it.
Rufus
Sorry, old man.
Hojo
Heh heh heh…
Hojo
That land is no one's.
Hojo
It's where the Reunion will take place… They will all gather here…
Hojo
I wonder if we'll see…Sephiroth?
Whirlwind Maze
We need to cross when the wind is calm, or we'll get swept off!
Wh…who---a
Uph…Se…phi…roth…
Received "Ether"!
Received "Hi-Potion"!
Whirlwind Maze
Received "Kaiser Knuckle"!
Whirlwind Maze
Sephiroth!!!
This is the end!
Jenova's cells…
Our…
Master…
He disappeared!?
I'll take care of the Black Materia. No matter what happens, I'll be right here.
He got away?
He might still be nearby…
I'll protect the Black Materia no matter what!
I feel something…danger?
Hey, hey,! What's goin' on?
I was just getting into it!
Vanished? That can't be!
Stay on alert. You never know when Sephiroth might appear.
What I wanted was a body. A seeing, hearing, moving body. Soon it will be…over.
Hmph… Heh, heh…
You're right. This is the end of this body's usefulness.
Our purpose is to deliver the Black
Materia to our master.
Those who carry Jenova's cells…
Of course…Sephiroth.
Heh, heh, heh…
Take this!!
This is the end…for all of you.
Received "Black Materia"!
Received "Poison Ring"!
Received "MP Turbo" Materia!
You cannot take on anymore Materia. Please discard some Materia.
Whirlwind Maze
BARRET
Are CLOUD and the others alright?
Are CLOUD and the others alright?
But what's up with that? One little piece of Materia, destroying the planet…
What the…?
The hell was that?
H, huh!?
Hey…guys!
Where are we? Where did we end up?
TIFA!!
Something's weird here! It got pitch black all of a sudden, and everyone disappeared!
Yea…yeah!
I don't know what's goin' on, but let's just get on with it.
Everyone's waiting! CLOUD's in trouble!
Please come. Help us!
Over there!
…hee hee hee… And remember… …the Black Materia!
BARRET, you're here! I'm so glad!!
RED XIII, you're here! I'm so glad!!
I wonder how CLOUD and the others are?
It's hard to believe… such a small piece of Materia could destroy the Planet.
What the!?
Is everyone all right?
What's going on?
Everyone!!
Where am I!? Don't leave me alone!
TIFA!!
Something is strange… Why was it dark all of a sudden and where is everybody?
R, right!
I'm not sure I understand… but I'll go if you want me to.
Received Key Item "Black Materia"!
Jenova's cells…
…hmm. So that's what this is all about.
The Jenova Reunion…
I'll explain later. Right now, the only thing I'm thinking about is beating Sephiroth.
He's here. The real Sephiroth is just beyond here.
It's both incredibly wicked and cruel…
But it's releasing a powerfully strong will from deep within the Planet's wound.
…The Black Materia is back in our hands.
Now all we have to do is defeat Sephiroth and that'll be the end of it.
I'm going to face Sephiroth.
Sephiroth is inside.
Don't give it to ANYONE. I'm counting on you.
Hold on to this… I don't trust myself.
I don't think I can…
We're going in first! You guys stay and keep watch.
Sephiroth… What a damn crazy #*&^%.
Give the Black Materia to...
Give to BARRET
Don't Give to BARRET
Damn! The pressure's on now.
Not Sephiroth!? You mean all this time it wasn't Sephiroth we've been after?
But Sephiroth is…
We'd better not take the Black Materia any further. Why don't you give it to someone else to hold on to?
Let's find Sephiroth!!
What's happening, CLOUD? That wasn't Sephiroth!
CLOUD, be careful!
Give the Black Materia to...
Give to RED XIII.
Don't give to RED XIII.
You want me to take the Black Materia? All right, I understand.
Hoo-boy…
Let me catch some shut-eye.
Me and Black Materia just don't mix.
What!? You mean that wasn't Sephiroth? All that time I was following this …thing?
Shouldn't we hurry? The real Sephiroth is still close, right?
I don't want anything to do with that Black Materia!
You serious!? That's not Sephiroth!
Something feels rea---lly weird here!
No, not the Black Materia, please.
So it wasn't Sephiroth…?
You never know when Sephiroth may show up… so don't let your guard down.
How about if you hold on to the Black Materia?
You mean… we weren't in pursuit of Sephiroth?
Whirlwind Maze
Hmm…I see,
Guess I shouldn't have worried about it.
TIFA, you'll be alright now.
Yeah, sorry I made you worry. I solved the mystery.
I'll explain it to you later. I need to do something now.
Sure, OK.
I think I overdid it a little, too.
Really?
What…do you mean?
Nibelheim…
Why Nibelheim!? Are you high on Mako or something?
But, how!? A dream?  An illusion?
But TIFA! Isn't this an illusion?
But why Nibelheim? This is freaky, REALLY freaky!
Why, is it an illusion?
What the hell? Why Nibelheim!?
This is an illusion Sephiroth made up.
He's trying to confuse us.
It'll be all right. As long as we know it's an illusion, there's nothing to be afraid of.
Come on, let's keep going.
Yeah, you're right…
Look!!
That ain't CLOUD… The hell is he?
CLOUD's not here… I wonder who…this is?
CLOUD, something's strange here. Who is this guy?
Huh---? CLOUD's not here.
That's not CLOUD. Who is this man?
CLOUD's not here…
Stop…Sephiroth.
This is so stupid…
How the hell're we gonna get outta here?
Is this illusion going to continue forever? How do we get out of it?
Come on, we have to hurry back to the real world!
I don't want to be in an illusion. Let's get back to the real world!
Now, how can we get out of here?
Hey, CLOUD. Let's get back to the real world, OK?
CLOUD… It's just an illusion.
Don't worry about it…
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
What is this? What happened?
Calm down, TIFA.
Sephiroth is near. Anything could happen.
Nibelheim
Hey, you alright!?
Damn! This was an illusion.
You all right!?
We were in an illusion…
Everyone OK!?
Umm…this was a hallucination.
He…hey, you! You alright!?
Oh, a dream! But it felt so real…
Are you all right?
Hmm…it was an illusion.
He…hey you! You alright!?
Damn! This was all made up.
Sephiroth! I know you're listening! I know what you want to say!
That I wasn't in Nibelheim five years ago.
That's it, isn't it?
Sephiroth
I see you finally understand.
What you are trying to say is that you want to confuse me, right?
But…even making me see those things won't affect me.
I remember it all. The heat of the fire…the pain in my body…and in my heart!
Sephiroth
Oh, is that so?
You are just a puppet… You have no heart…and cannot feel any pain…
How can there be any meaning in the memory of such a being?
What I have shown you is reality. What you remember, that is the illusion.
Sephiroth
…Do you understand?
I don't want to understand.
But, I want to ask you one thing. Why…why are you doing this?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…
I want to take you back to your real self.
The one who gave me the Black Materia that day…
Sephiroth
Who would have ever thought a failed experiment would prove so useful?
Hojo would die if he knew.
Hojo!? What does he have to do with me!?
Sephiroth
Five years ago you were…
…constructed by Hojo, piece by piece, right after Nibelheim was burnt.
A puppet made up of vibrant Jenova cells, her knowledge, and the power of the Mako.
An incomplete Sephiroth-clone. Not even given a number. …That is your reality.
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…
CLOUD… Don't listen to him…
Cover your ears! Close your eyes!
All that talk of Hojo constructing you is a lie.
Don't we have our memories together?
Being kids together, starlit nights…
What's wrong, TIFA? I'm not affected by it.
…I wasn't paying attention to him.
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…TIFA…
Why are you so worried and scared by those words?
Hmm…Shall I show everyone here what's in your heart?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha… You don't look well.
…TIFA? Is Sephiroth right?
CLOUD…
What's wrong, TIFA?
Why are you so scared? Don't worry about me. I'm all right.
No matter how confused I am, I'll never believe a word that Sephiroth says.
It's true that sometimes I can't figure out who I am.
There's a lot of things muddled up in my memories.
But, TIFA…
You said, 'Long time no see, CLOUD' right?
Those words will always support me.
I am the one you grew up with. I'm CLOUD of Nibelheim.
No matter how much I lose faith in myself, that is the truth.
That's why you shouldn't be so scared.
No matter what anyone else says to me, it's your opinion that counts…
No, that's not true, CLOUD…
What's not? I'm the same CLOUD you grew up with, aren't I?
That's not what I mean… I don't know how to say it…
CLOUD, I need some time… Just give me a little time…
Sephiroth
CLOUD… Don't blame TIFA.
I'll explain.
Sephiroth
The ability to change one's looks, voice, and words, is the power of Jenova.
Inside of you, Jenova has merged with TIFA's memories, creating you.
Sephiroth
Out of TIFA's memory…
Sephiroth
A boy named CLOUD might've just been a part of them.
CLOUD…
Please…don't think right now.
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha… Think, CLOUD!
…CLOUD? Ha, ha, ha…Oh, excuse me. You never had a name…
Shut up…Sephiroth.
Sephiroth
You still don't understand? Then…
Sephiroth
Do you remember the picture that we took before we headed for Mt. Nibel?
Sephiroth
…TIFA, you remember, right?
Sephiroth
But there is no way he would know.
Sephiroth
Now…what happened to that picture?
Sephiroth
…Is this it?
Sephiroth
…Do you want to see it? It turned out pretty good.
CLOUD…Don't…
I…should be in the picture.
Even if I'm not in there, no worry. This is just an illusory world Sephiroth made up.
It's a photograph.
…Just as I thought.
This picture's a fake. The truth is in my memory.
…Five years ago, I came back to Nibelheim, to inspect the reactor. I was sixteen.
The town hadn't changed at all. What did I do? Oh yeah…
…SOLDIER, First Class?
…SOLDIER? When did I enter SOLDIER?
Stop, CLOUD!!
How did I join SOLDIER?
Why…why can't I remember?
I'm…I'm…
That's right…
…I didn't have to worry about it, because I was…
…CLOUD?
Let's go, TIFA. I'm…I'm all right.
I saw my mom. I saw the people in town.
Yeah, I went to TIFA's room. There, I…
I played the piano!
I looked in the drawers!
I read the letter addressed to TIFA!
I spent the night and went to the reactor in Mt. Nibel. I was excited about it.
Because that was my first mission after becoming First Class in SOLDIER.
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
He---y! Is anyone here?
Give me a hand!
Zangan
Hey it's you! You're still sane, right?
Zangan
Then come over here and help me!
Zangan
I'll check this house. You check that one over there!
Zangan
Hey! What about the other houses?
…Sephi…roth
…Hey, ummm… Am I going to die?
Terrible…
Sephiroth… This is too terrible…
What's…next?
Stop it already!!
This is bad… Just like Corel.
This is terrible… Did Sephiroth do this?
This is insane…
Wow… I didn't know it was THIS bad…
All this happened while I slept?
This is terrible…
…This is what actually happened five years ago.
But…
It's probably not me that will come out of the Shinra mansion.
He's going to try and show us another stupid illusion.
See…didn't I tell you?
I don't want to…watch this. CLOUD…Don't watch.
…What's wrong, TIFA? I told you before, right?
As long as we know that it's just an illusion, there's no need to be scared.
Inside Northern Cave
Scarlet
Wow!! That's amazing!
Scarlet
It's all Materia!!
Rufus
The outside is rich with Mako energy. The inside is a treasure trove of Materia. This truly is the Promised Land.
Hojo
There is no such thing as the Promised Land. It's a legend…an old wives tale… …It's utterly ridiculous.
Rufus
Everything's as I imagined it to be. Isn't it splendid?
It is that kind of dullness that makes you a second-rate scientist.
Rufus
What's happening?
Scarlet
It's coming from within the wall! Something's in there! It's moving!
Hojo
Weapon…
Hojo
Then it really does exist… I didn't believe in it.
Rufus
What does this mean?
Hojo
…Weapon. A monster created by the Planet.
They appear when the Planet's in danger and destroy everything.
That's what was stated in Professor Gast's report.
Rufus
I never saw that report… Where is it?
Hojo
Here, right here.
Rufus
You keep a lot of things to yourself.
Scarlet
Mr. President… I've got a bad feeling about this place…
Rufus
Hmm…maybe we should go back to our ship now. We need to prepare for the inspection anyway.
Scarlet
Hey!!! Where did you come from?
…Don't know…
This place is going to get rough.
Better leave things to me and get out of here while you still can!!
Rufus
Leave things to you? Hmph…I don't know what you mean.
This is where the Reunion is happening. Where everything begins and ends.
CLOUD?
Hey! We're here to help you!
I'm here! I'm here to help you, CLOUD!
Thanks…BARRET. Where's the Black Materia?
Thanks…RED XIII. Where's the Black Materia?
It's safe. I have it.
It's safe. I'm holding on to it.
I'll take it from here. Give me the…Black Materia.
You alright?
Are you all right, CLOUD?
Okay then, here. Had a lot of pressure holding this thing.
Then…here you go. I was a little apprehensive holding this thing.
Thanks. Leave the rest to me.
Sorry to make you worry, but I'm all right now.
I'll make sure that the Black Materia is delivered.
CLOUD!!
Come on. The Black Materia…
Please wait! Just a little longer!!
Everyone, thanks for everything. And…I'm sorry.
…Sorry.
…Sorry.
Especially you, TIFA. I'm really sorry.
You've been so good to me… I don't know what to say…
I never lived up to being 'CLOUD'.
TIFA… Maybe one day you'll meet the real 'CLOUD'.
Professor Hojo…
Hojo
Ha,ha,ha… this is perfect!!!
It means that my experiment was a complete success.
Hojo
What number were you? Huh?  Where is your tattoo?
Professor Hojo… I don't have a number.
You didn't give me one because you said I was a failed experiment.
Hojo
What?
Hojo
What the--? You mean only a failure made it here?
I didn't know the 'Reunion' already started.
But, here I am. And I brought the Black Materia with me Just as Sephiroth wanted.
Hojo
Shut up, miserable failure…
Professor…please give me a number. Please, Professor…
Won't you give me one? …Professor?
Hojo
I never dreamed what I thought was a success…was actually a failure, and that which I considered a failure was my greatest success…
Rufus
What are you guys talking about?
You can't hear my voice?
No, don't!!! Please! Stop CLOUD!
CLOUD!!
Hojo
Did you see it!! It's Sephiroth! So he IS here!
Hojo
This is perfect! Both Jenova's Reunion and Sephiroth's  will!
They won't be diffused into the Lifestream, but gathered here!
Mwa, haa, ha…
What are you so happy about, Professor? You know what this means, don't you?
CLOUD has the Black Materia!
Sephiroth is going to summon Meteor! Every single person is going to die!
Rufus
Whatever I say now is too little… too late. We must evacuate.
Rufus
I want you all to come with me. There's still much more I want to know.
Yo!   CLOUD! Stop! Don't do it!
CLOUD, NO! Stop!  Please!
CLOUD!!
Rufus
Who…was that?
Hojo
…He's a Sephiroth-clone I created after the real Sephiroth died five years ago.
Jenova cells and Mako, with my knowledge and skills, have been combined with science and nature to bring him to life.
Hojo
…I'm not wild about the failure part, but the Jenova Reunion Theory has now been proven.
Hojo
You see, even if Jenova's body is dismembered, it will eventually become one again. That's what is meant by Jenova's Reunion.
Hojo
I have been waiting for the Reunion to start. Five years have passed, and now the clones have begun to return.
Hojo
I thought the clones would begin to gather at Midgar where Jenova is stored.
But my predictions were not entirely correct. Jenova itself began to move away from the Shinra Building.
Hojo
But being the genius that I am, I soon figured it out. You see it was all Sephiroth's doing.
Sephiroth is not just content to diffuse his will into the Lifestream. He wants to manipulate the Clones himself.
Yes, that was how it got started.
Hojo
I wondered where the clones were going, but I was never able to figure it out.
I couldn't figure it out either.
Hojo
The one thing that I did know was that Sephiroth was at their final destination.
I wasn't pursuing Sephiroth.
I was being summoned by Sephiroth.
All the anger and hatred I bore him, made it impossible for me to ever forget him. That and what he gave me.
Sephiroth? Sephiroth? I'm here. And I brought you the Black Materia.
Show yourself to me. Where are you?
Sephiroth… So we finally meet again.
Great Cave
North Cave 5 -3
CLOUD…
CLOUD…
I didn't know what to do. I was always like that…
What's the matter?
ohhh…
…poor kid.
Ooouugh…
oo…uh…agh
Are you all right?
Uh…uh…TIFA?
TIFA?
TIFA!
…?
Oh, CLOUD!
That's right. I'm CLOUD.
Is it really you, CLOUD? I never thought I'd find you here!
Yeah, it's been a while.
What happened to you? You don't look well.
Yeah? It's nothing. I'm okay.
How long has it been?
Five years.
…
What is it?
…it's really been a long time.
Actually, it's been seven years.
You joined SOLDIER but quit after the Sephiroth incident, and now you're a mercenary…
You told me a lot about what happened after you left Nibelheim… 
But…
…Something was wrong. I felt there was something strange about the things you talked about.
All the things you didn't know that you should, And other things you shouldn't know that you did.
I wanted to make sure…
But then I heard…you were going far away…
And I didn't want that…
…I didn't know what to do. So, I thought I needed more time.
And that's why I told you about the AVALANCHE job. I wanted to be with you and watch you.
