You…you! Why are you here? Rude of the Turks should've been here!!
Too bad. Those guys are over there.
Oh man…the Turks, being done in like that…  But, I won't let you through!
Urrrrgh…
Hey! Just when I thought somethin' was goin' on, you come back!
Hey! What the hell're you guys doin'!?
Listen to me, Captain. We're gonna launch this rocket!
Huh? What are you talkin' 'bout?
We're gonna load a Materia bomb in this and blow up Meteor.
Our rocket's gonna save the planet!
Urrrrgh. Man this is so COOL!!
Wait a minute!
Shut up!! Just shut the hell up!
How's the rocket?
It's pretty much OK.
We planned to run it into Meteor on Auto-Pilot, but the most important device is broken.
Broken? How's the repair goin'?
Shera's doin' it…
Oh great! What a buncha wizards you guys are! She's gonna take a 100 years!
I'll take over, so don't worry about the Auto-Pilot!
Hey, go ahead! Go tell everyone!
All right, Captain. Good luck.
Hey, CID! What're you doing!?
There are generations of knowledge and wisdom inside the Materia.
We're gonna borrow their powers and save the Planet from Sephiroth.
There's no way that we can lose the Huge Materia. You understand that, right?
Yeah, I understand. I understand that Materia is precious, and I also understand what you're thinking.
But listen.
I don't give a rat's ass whether it's science or magical power.
No, I guess if I had to choose, I'd rather put my money on the power of science.
Humans only used to walk around on the ground but now they can fly!
And finally, we're about to go into outer space.
Science is a 'Power' created and developed by humans. And science just might be what saves this Planet.
I was able to earn my living, thanks to science. So to me, there's nothing greater!
Now quit your worrying bout what Shinra's gonna do!
I don't want to regret not having done something later.
But, CID…
Shut the hell up!! I don't wanna hear it!!
Alright, time to get to work! Anyone who ain't involved, get the hell outta here!
What the hell? What the hell happened!?
Hey-hey!
Palmer! What the hell did'ya do!?
They said they finished repairing the Auto-Pilot. So, I laun---ched it!
Goddamn Shera! Why'd she pick today to get fast!
DAMN! Won't even budge! It's completely locked up!
Hey-hey-hey! Almost lift off!
What the!? No countdown!? It just don't seem the same without it!
Hey!!!! Hey-hey!!! Blast-----off!
Can't we do somethin'? We can't jus' leave it.
Can't we do something? If it goes on, we're…
What should we do? Are we all going to die?
Hey old man! Do something!
What shall we do? What shall we do?
I'm a toy, so I don't care, but for all of you it's a different story…
We're in space now. A long rest…
That damn Palmer went outta his way to lock the Auto-Pilot device. We might not be able to change course.
…Is this the end?
Huh? What the hell're you sayin'? You're still young, don't give up so easily!
I'm not gonna crash into Meteor.
Just watch.
I keep an escape pod on the rocket just for emergencies like this.
I deciphered the lock code on the escape pod. We'll bail right before we crash into Meteor.
Let's see, how's the course set?
Yup, it's headed for a collision with Meteor.
I finally made it… outer space…
Hey wait a second!
What's gonna happen to the Huge Materia?
Hey, what about the Huge Materia?
But, what are we going to do with the Huge Materia? Are we just going to give it up?
Hmm? What are we gonna do with the Huge Materia?
If you don't want it, maybe… you could…give it to ME!
By the way, what are we goin' to do with the Huge Materia?
Then the remaining question is what to do with the Huge Materia.
If you want the Materia, do whatever you want!
…You sure?
I dunno…
I know what I said a minute ago.
But maybe all that I really wanted was just to go into outer space.
So, why don't you all do whatever you think is right?
The Materia should be there after you climb that ladder.
If you're goin' to get the Materia, it's this way.
The escape pod is this way. Please hurry.
So this is…outer space…
So long, Shinra No.26…
Man…it's the real thing… I'm really here in outer space…
Hurry. I'm going to detach the escape pod.
Hey, Shera! Does this pod really fly?
It'll be OK.
I've checked it.
… Then I'm relieved.
…Thanks.
I finally found the Huge Materia…
It's structured so that the lock can be opened if we enter the passcode from this control panel.
Hey CLOUD, you know how to use it, right?
Everytime it says, Enter Passcode,' push [OK] [CANCEL] [MENU] [OR] [SWITCH].
If you punch in the right code, it'll unlock and you can get the Huge Materia!
Whoa, pretty good! You got the passcode in a single try!
You must've known the passcode. If not, it's impossible.
Passcode Input Error
Unauthorized User Identified
Protection System will activate in 3 minutes
Seems like you missed the code!
If we don't enter the correct passcode before the protection system activates, we won't be able to get the Materia back!
So, what order am I supposed to enter the passcode in?
There is the control panel.
Try and operate it?
Enter Passcode
Enter Passcode 1
Enter Passcode 2
Enter Passcode 3
Enter Passcode 4
I'm pretty sure that the last code was [MENU]. No, maybe it was [CANCEL]…?
The second one's not [MENU]. I'm sure of it!
I dunno. Just try and punch in the code randomly.
I think the first code wasn't [SWITCH].
I think the second code wasn't [CANCEL]…
Code No. 3 was [CANCEL] …I think.
Hmm, I can't remember. Give me some more time!
Did you use [MENU]? I'm pretty sure you didn't…
I have a feeling you push [OK] only once…
I think there was a key that you have to push twice…
I heard there's a passcode only the top people in Shinra know.
We probably have to enter that. Try and enter some codes while I try and remember that passcode!
Alright, CLOUD!! It's unlocked!
Yup, my great advice saved the day.

Ahhh &$#$#! The Protection System just activated!
…CLOUD, too bad, but we gotta let it go.
ALRIGHT! Let's get outta here while we can!
CID!!
I'm gonna do whatever I can.
Grrrgh!
Damn! My leg's stuck in the debris.
Don't worry 'bout me. Hurry up and go! If you don't hurry, the rocket's gonna crash into Meteor!
…I can't go without my friends.
You %#@&! No time to worry 'bout other people!
Tank Number 8 blew up…/ So Tank Number 8…/ really was malfunctioning…
Shera…/ You were right.
But, …this is the end for me.
Don't say that, CID.
Huh!? Shera!?
I tagged along. I'm coming to help you.
You stupid &$#%!!
…Damn! …Can't lift it!
…I can't! It's so heavy, I can't lift it…
I can't do anything with my strength alone..!
I can't budge it by myself!!
What shall we do? It won't budge!
…No. I can't lift it.
You're stupid. You're really $#&^%$* stupid.
… … Sorry.
Head out?
Last Dungeon

Excuse me, but could you wait?
Learner Pilot (L14)

Uh, wait
Learner Pilot (L14 Limit Break!)
Yo, CLOUD! Whacha gonna do?
Move it!
Wait
Full Pilot
CLOUD, what do you want to do?
Go on
Wait a minute
Listen, CLOUD.
We're right in the middle of the mission for the Huge Materia, right?
I know this's kinda outta the blue, but Junon has an Underwater Reactor.
As far as I can see, that's the only one left.
That's that. Let's go!
Rufus and the other's plan was a failure…
What a bust… But I kinda hoped it'd work.
We been botherin' them as much as we can…
But there ain't no other way… Wonder if we've been wrong all this time?
Makes you worry, doesn't it?
Don't worry! Think!
Hey! The girl's right.
You start worryin' and there's no stoppin' it! Things just start fallin' apart and get worse and worse.
You're pretty damn optimistic ! You up to somethin'?
Yeah, I been thinkin' about this and that. All the time we been up here lookin' at the planet.
I been thinkin' even when we were floatin' in the ocean in that escape pod.
I've…been thinking, too. About the universe…planet…ocean.
How wide and big… No matter where I go and what I do it won't change a thing.
Maybe you're right.
But I came up with something different.
I always thought this Planet was so huge. But lookin' at it from space, I realized it's so small.
We're just floatin' in the dark. ……kind of makes you feel powerless.
On top of that it's got Sephiroth festerin' inside it like a sickness.
That's why I say this Planet's still a kid.
A little kid sick and trembling in the middle of this huge universe.
Someone's gotta protect it.
Ya follow me? That someone is us.
CID…that's beautiful.
Yo! CID! You even got to me!
Now what? How're we gonna protect the Planet from Meteor?
…I'm still thinkin' about that.
Huh!?
Did you…hear something?
Maybe it's the Planet's scream… Or is it Meteor?
It's the Planet's scream. I'm sure of it.
Hey, how do we know that this is really the Planet's scream?
Did you forget?
Bugenhagen told us.
Bugenhagen…
Let's go see Grandfather! To Cosmo Canyon!
I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something that will be helpful!
