Wall Market
This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find TIFA fast.
Please come in. There's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter now.
Please, stop by.
According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate.
So, build your strength by having a plate of our food.
It's a weird world we live in, so eat up and work hard.
I just can't make up my mind… Mmm.
Huh? About what?
Hmmm, don't make me say it… It's the shop down on the right.
Nope, I just can't make up my mind. Here, you take this. You won't be able to get in without it.
Received Key Item Member's Card!
Say, you're a cutie, heh, heh, heh.
Hey boy! You sure got a good-lookin' heifer there!
Take her to the Don's place, and you'll make a mint.
Hey! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job!
Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune!
I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.
We're not leavin' this city no matter what happens.
Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?
We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?
Hey, y'all. Please stay here!
Oh… what should I do? Should I just buy it?
That was scary…
Seems like everything has frills on it.
Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?
It came down from the sky.
But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some, too.
I wish I could live with a real cat.
It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.
What? Are you ladies going to eat, too?
Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over.
I don't know what's gonna happen next. But first, you gotta fill your stomach.
What's wrong, AERIS?
What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but…
…Oh, yeah.
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. CLOUD.
All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?
All this belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps picking things up and saving them here.
Oh, you mean the owner who has a tank in his shop.
But any way you look at it, it's just trash…
Is this pile of trash getting bigger?
Yes, I think so.
A lot of things came falling down when the Sector 7 pillar fell.
Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff when it came falling down.
Oh is that why? He seems pretty suspicious these days.
Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?
Oh, you know! I wonder what he's doing?
Yeah! It gives me the chills.
Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
Honey Bee Inn
Hey!! CLOUD!!
Man… Should I go…or not?
…I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!!
Hey!! Aren't you?
What?? You mean you're…too?
Yeah, me too.
Don't bring me down to your level.”
You're TIFA's childhood friend, and you brought a new girlfriend to a place like this!?
What kind of guy are you!!
What…me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My last memories of Midgar…you know.
But… That guy over there kinda scares me.
What the hell!? You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy right now!!
I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!!
Mmm? That's too bad.
This used to be where the Honey Bee Inn was!! Now, it's a barrack for the Shinra soldiers.
Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs like you may meet their destiny here!!
Pretty good, huh? Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha !!
All the young bucks gather and deceive this innocent young girl…
Ohhh boy!! It's healthy, it's wholesome!!
Yeow!! Hey, Princess!!
Uh…ummm I, I…
Uh…ummm…
I'm…Jo…Johnny… Nice to meet you.
Yeah, I only talk to the pretty ones.
Mmmm, you're the one. You're just great.
Urrrrgh…no way… I can't go on.
Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it.
Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs like you may meet their destiny here!!
You looking for a girlfriend too?
You know a girl named TIFA?
This place doesn't interest me.
Hey, you're pretty fast. TIFA's our newest girl.
But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.
Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.
Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride.
Hmm…Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.
Mmm! Please, please!
The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. Shoo, shoo.
Hey! Is that a "Member's Card" I see shining in your hot little hand? Please, come in.
…Hmmmm. Sure, good excuse…
Looks like I need to go inside to complete my disguise.
See ya!
Uh, sir!! It's almost closing time…
So, please remember any personal belongings.
Uuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of cute girls…
It just seems natural to get cautious…
I bought some pretty flowers from AERIS.
500 gil, a little expensive. Well, at least I got her name.
AERIS… Thanks for the flower and 1 gil.
I'll treasure this! I'm going to dry it and keep it for good luck.
I asked AERIS for a date…
And she said not even if I paid her 1,000,000 gil. Her flowers cost 300 gil, too… She's a good business woman.
They bought lots of flowers from me.
It's closing time. …yawn…I'm so sleepy…
Sir, is everything all right? Look, AERIS looks so lonely.
Uurrgh! So, this is it for today, huh?
Ummm, young girls…soft skin. Ummm, OK, I'm refreshed now!
Mmmm? Pretty hard. You work out?
That's funny. A hard, spiky hairstyle! Looks kinda familiar…
Hey!! It's you!!
Sorry, but I already heard about you. In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things.
We only let cultured customers in! Got it? Then you'd better leave!
Heee… The Shinra have occupied this shop!
This shop is now under Shinra rule.
Corneo Hall
Hey, you got a cute one with you!
This is Don Corneo's mansion. He's a big shot here in Wall Market.
Listen, the Don doesn't like men. So get the hell outta here.
Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again…
Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.
I'll tell TIFA about you.
No!! You can't!!
Why?
Do you know what kind of …place this is?
Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion.
But, I just can't let you go in alone…Oh, man…
First…we need to find out if TIFA's alright…
What's so funny, AERIS?
CLOUD, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.
WHAT!?
Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
AERIS! I can't…
You ARE worried about TIFA, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!
A friend, huh? Sounds pretty good to me.
The Don will be happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can even…heh heh.
Bar
HEY…someone's IN here… Don't look!
Got any medicine on you? I'm too hyper…and…ugh.
What…urk…
Give her medicine
Don't give her it
Huh? You'll really give me some? Thanks.
Phew, I feel better now. This is for your kindness.
What is this? Oh well.
It didn't do a thing, but thanks anyways. Here, this is for your kindness.
Wasn't there a Pharmacy here?

Hey, could you do somethin' for me? Someone's been in there all day and they're not comin' out. I can't hold it anymore!
Whoops!
Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter.
Man, times are bad.
Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?
I own the Clothes Shop… but I ain't your father.
I didn't say that…
Make me some clothes.
I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.
CLOUD, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to him.
Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.
You know, Mister.
He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl.
So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him…
What!? A tough lookin' guy like that?
So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?
…might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.
Then you'll do it for us?
Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?
Something…
That feels clean
That feels soft
hm, hm, hm, and?
And something…
shiny
that shimmers
Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste as him. I'll go talk to him.
Hey, hold on. Wait till I get an image in my head. Gulp…ummm, that's good.
…And then?
Hmm, hmmm, oh really?
Scary, isn't it? You just never know when the plate might come crashing down.
Yeah. I'd like to climb up to the plate if I could.

Welcome. It'll be  Gil per night.

Buy the one for 200 Gil
Buy the one for 100 Gil

I don't have enough money. I'll get him the other one.
Thank you very much. Please come again.
Materia Store
…We're closed now.
How was it?
Not yet.
Hmm, I'm countin' on you.
I'm sorry, we're sold out and I've got nothing for you.
Hey man. Got a minute? I need to talk…man to man.
What is it?
Not interested
Sorry about that. Just forget it.
Really! I really appreciate it.
I'm sorry, but young lady… Would you turn the other way, for a second?
Why?
…AERIS.
Gosh!
I'm sorry, lady.
Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the Inn?
I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't ask a girl to go get it.
What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, I got in a fight with the guy at the Inn and can't go there anymore. Come on, so how 'bout it?
I'll go
Finished?
Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done.
I got it.
Oh, really!! Hey!
Geez.
And, what was it?
A protein drink set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more business than him, his head'll spin.
A Stamina Drink Set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more business than him, his head'll spin.
A Muscle Relaxing Cream Set. That jerk. I'm gonna do so much more business than him, his head'll spin.

You want somethin'? I don't wanna hear any complaints bout how things look.
How 'bout it? Wanna buy somethin'?
You goin' up to the plate? You better have batteries.
You're gonna sell me something you just found?
Hey, you knew? I repaired them, so it's all right.
Why do I need batteries to climb up to the plate?
You'll find out when you get there. How 'bout 100 gil for each?
All right, I'll take them

Oh, all right…I'll buy it

Men's Hall
Oh dear. I've gained weight again.
Join the club.

I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe.
Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.
These days, you've got to have strength. Come on, you should work out.
All right…1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm.
I'm doing my best, bro'!
How's… this!?
Are you the one who wants to be cute?
Cute?

And about the wig…
Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya.

Big Bro!! The only way you're gonna get cuter is if you can beat Big Bro!!
That's right!
So, you've got to compete with us!
You're right. Let's do squats.
All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!
Are you…
THE beautiful Bro?
What? You didn't know? Always running around here sayin' Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that…
Never mind that, come over here.
No, I'll explain the rules.
From the ready position, push [SWITCH] to squat, push [CANCEL] to get up, and push [OK] to go back to the ready position.
So it's [SWITCH], [CANCEL], [OK] in that order.
Got it?
Don't have it
Got it
Then I'll explain it again.
Whoever has the most squats after 30 seconds gets the wig.
I'm not going to lose.
Big Bro's wig is MINE!!
Just be quiet…
It's not fair for you to start right away, So, you want some practice?
A little
Don't need to practice
Then, start practicing!
You had  squats.
Now let's begin the real thing. Start!
He had  squats and you had  squats.
Sorry You lose.

Boutique
Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress.
Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?
What's the problem?
Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses.
And, where is your father?
He's probably plastered at the bar.
So… You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?
Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.
!
You'd help me bring him back?
Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?
Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore…
All right, we'll do something. Let's go, CLOUD!

You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. Go and talk to them.
…'like you'? AERIS, what did you tell him?
Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!
Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.
Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?
Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, so the dress is on the house.
Walk more nicely like…this, Miss CLOUD.
…What do you mean 'nicely'?
Oh you're so cute, Miss CLOUD.
Looks like everything went well. He's been making the dress ever since he came back.
So? Were you able to get the wig?
Looks like you got it. So try it on for size.
Welcome. Please take your time.
Don't push! Hooligan!
You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it.
So, how was it? Were you able to see him?
Hmm, good. It looks good on you.
Looks like you're all set. Now try it on, and let's see how it fits.
Aren't you going to change?
Okay…I'm ready

…Hmm. It's REALLY somethin'.
Aaah, I want one. Do you have one that'll look good on me, too?
How's this?
How about that one?
Father, what are you talking about? This one's much better.
No, what are you saying? This one.

I'm going to go change.
…No peeking!
So? How do I look?
Oh, you're no fun!
You're…
weird.
Sir…
Choose the BEST 'flavor' from the 4 rooms.
But you can only choose from an unoccupied room.
Hurry…
Please choose a room. (Gosh, he's so weird… but then again, they all are.)
Looks like this room's being used.
Take a listen
Take a peek
…Wooo…ow!!
Looks like it's unoccupied.
I guess I'll take this one
Hold ground
I'll take this room.
I wonder if they'd change it if I asked?
I want this room
I've changed my mind… …I want to change rooms.
All right. Now all we have to do is enter the room.
You're not going to have a change of heart, are you?
Don't make me repeat myself
I'm still trying to decide
Oh, don't be angry with me… (Geez…this one's probably the violent type…)
There you are. Enjoy yourself (You moody creepo!)
All right, please.

…wheez…puff… You know, Grandma…
Is this the room?
…whew… I know our son rented this for us and all, but…
It's too nice for us. Big round bed, gorgeous tub, I just can't get comfortable.
Don't worry about it. It's a high class neighborhood, in the Big City.
You keep complainin' and we'll get in trouble.
Hey Grandma. What's the name of the company our son works for?
Oh, Grandpa. Did you forget again?
…heave… It's getting worse…
It's Shinra, you know, Shinra, Inc.? It's the biggest company in the city.
If it's the biggest company, it must be something.
Yeah. It IS really something.
He's doing well, and he told me that he's been promoted to department head.
Oh…thanks to him we're able to stay in a room like this.
Yeah, I'm really grateful.

Psst… (I can't tell him…)
Psst… (Come on!! Oh, well…)
Psst… (I'm so disgusted with the President.)
Psst… (This happens every time we come to Midgar on business.)
Psst… (What're you complaining about? You're just holding the lights. I've gotta wear this heavy armor!)
Psst… (I know, I know… but it's all part of the job.)
Psst… (Oh yeah, did you hear? The President's wife found out about this little hobby of his.)
Psst… (Ha, ha…no way, I didn't know that.)
Psst… (Oh, looks like he's done. Man, I'm glad!!)

Ohhh…I'm sorry. Please remove the ancient curse!

Looks like I'm always going to be facing crises all my life…
Don't be so embarrassed! Loosen up, bubby!
Let's wash off all our sweat and dirt together!
Bubby! So you're the intimate type, eh?
…heave…pant… Wow!! Would ya look at that!?
Isn't bathing great?
It soothes you.
How is it, bubby!?
Feels good, huh?
It hurts
Too stuffy in here…
I don't feel good. Let me out…
You'll get used to it. Try counting to ten.

Do you wanna join my 'Young bubby's' group?

Well, if it's to save TIFA… I guess there's no choice.
Hmm? You!?
What are you doing in a place like this?
That's what I wanted to ask you. Should you be foolin' around here?
You think problems go away by just thinkin' about them?
You can't change anything by just sitting back and looking at it.
What are you saying?
It's started moving.
Wake up!
Wake up!!
Phew, I'm so relieved.
Bubby!! I heard you collapsed.
No, no, no.
Don't get so uptight.
Huh…?
Ugh…!
Hmm? They say youth is so long yet so short.

Hey, what do you think about me?

NO WAY! I'M SO SHOCKED!!
Oh my!! Are you embarrassed? (Man!! Why are you so moody?)
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm… Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm… Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm…
Phew…… …it's so tiring.
Oh!!
Is something the matter?

OH!!

(You think he's after me? Really? This guy makes me sick… And his eyes are weird, too…)
(Yeah, don't hurt these guys' feelings. Let's at least say 'hi' to him.)
Uhh… Hel…Hello.
What a nice day, today.
Introduce yourself
Say Goodbye
By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm CLOUD, a jack of all trades.
Oh, yeah…? Welcome, CLOUD.
(Gross!  Don't get carried away, remember your name is 'Pooch!')
BYE!! (Phew…I'm safe now…)
Take care…CLOUD.
Uh…. Do you put makeup on?
Eyaaah!
Don't watch!!
Eyaaah!
Don't!
…Oh my…
If I were to dress up like a woman… Then I've got to really prepare carefully.
I should be able to put makeup on here.
Have them make me up
Don't do it
I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me, too?
Oh…my…
Damn!! Your friend's hot, too!
Come in, come in!!
Two ladies coming through!!
Corneo Hall,1f.
Hey, ladies.
I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't wander around…
The Don's waiting in his room…  Ha ha ha…
Now's our chance. Let's find TIFA.
I wonder where she is?
Closed…
Office of
Don Corneo
Keep Out!
Torture Room
…TIFA?
Nice to meet you. I'm AERIS.
CLOUD's told me a lot about you.
…And you are?
Hey you're the one with CLOUD in the park…
Right, with CLOUD.
Oh…
Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
What do you mean, Don't worry'…about what?
No, don't misunderstand.
CLOUD and I grew up together. Nothing more.
Poor CLOUD, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.
Right, CLOUD?
CLOUD?
????
CLOUD!?
Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?
Never mind, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?
Slow down, let me answer.
I'm dressed like this because there was no other way to get in here.
I'm all right. AERIS helped me out.
Oh, AERIS did…
TIFA, explain what you're doing in a place like this?
Yeah, um…
Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
Please, go on with your private conversation.
…I'm glad you're OK.
Thanks. What happened?
When we got back from the Sector 5 reactor, we saw a weird man.
BARRET caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
That's when the Don's name popped up.
Right, Don Corneo.
BARRET told me to leave the lech alone…
But something's been bothering me.
I see. So you wanted the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
Well, I made it here, but now I'm stuck.
Corneo is looking for a bride.
Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then… …well…
Anyway, I have to be the …girl for tonight.
Sorry, but I overheard…
If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
I guess so, but…
We have two here, right?
No, AERIS! I can't involve you.
Oh? So it's all right for TIFA to be in danger?
No, I don't want TIFA in…
Is it all right?
I grew up in the slums… I'm used to danger.
Do you trust me?
Yes. Thanks, Ms. AERIS.
Call me AERIS.
He---y!!
It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!
I told you not to wander around… I tell ya, women nowadays…
Hurry up, will ya!
I guess I don't need to ask but, the other girl is…
me…right?
You're right, you didn't need…
…to ask.
They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
Ha ha. You know, you don't look bad, if ya don't look closely.
I wonder what BARRET would say if he could see you?
Embarrassed? Come on, speak up!
Hey, what's the secret?
No---!!
I'm so sorry!!
Corneo Hall,2f.
Kotch
All right, ladies!
Line up in front of the Don!
Don Corneo
Hmmm! Good, splendid!
Now, let's see… Which girl should I choose? Hmm---hmm---!
This one?

Woo-hoo, I've made up my mind!!
My choice for tonight is…

Received "Phoenix Down"!
TIFA!!
We've gotta help AERIS!!
Hey, don't you even care about how I am? ….nevermind, let's go!
Of course! If you take me lightly, you're gonna pay for it!!
No---!! Help!!

C'mon…just once… I won't tell…I promise!
I just wanted to act like I got a a cute girl…

I told you. I'm used to danger.
To tell you the truth, my heart was pounding!
Ye…yes, you're right… …let's hurry!
Ha ha ha… Wait, you…
Hey! You're…not them… you're…
Come, come, don't be so shy…
But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first…
Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by step. So come on!
No, that's not what I meant!
NO, STOP! Just, just wait a second!!
Come! Come!
Aoooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes Papa!!
I know…
But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start…
Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?
Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?
No…I wasn't asking about that…
Wait a minute! No, not yet!!
…What the hell? Who's there?
I'm sorry, Don.
You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?
What?
Shut up, we're asking the questions now…
What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell us…
…I'll chop it off.
No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
So…talk.
…I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.
By whom?
No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!
Talk! If you don't tell us…
…I'll rip it off.
Waaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!
Heidegger, the head of Peace Preservation!
The head of Peace Preservation!?
Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!
If you don't tell us…
…I'll smash it.
…You're serious, aren't you… …ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy.
…I'm not fooling around here either, you know.
Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.
And they're really going to crush them…literally. By breaking the supports holding up the plate above them.
Break the supports!?
You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING
and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums…
I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?
CLOUD, will you come with me to Sector 7?
Of course, TIFA.
Just a second!
No wait, it'll only take a second.
Why do you think scum like me babbled on about the truth?
Because I've given up on life
Because I'm sure I'll win
Because I'm clueless
Buuzzzzz! Wrong!
Woo-hoo!  Right!
Close, but no cigar!
Ahh, we're finally alone…
All right, pussycat… Come to daddy!!
You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you.
Do you…like me, too?
Of course!
Umm…
You sure do know how to make a guy feel good!
Then, wh…what do you want to DO?
Whatever YOU want, daddy
I don't care…
Oh man!  I can't stand it! All right, then…
Give me a kiss!! A KISS!!
All right…
Nope, can't do that…
Why? WHY? WHY?
Because I'm gonna need that mouth of yours to give me some information!!
A man!? You tricked me!!
Somebody get in here NOW!!
A man!? What's goin' on?
Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.
You're the ones from before! Wh…what the hell's going on?
Ju---st a minute!!
Were you really…?
Information? What information?
Th…then why?
You don't like me?
There…there isn't someone else, is there?
No, only you
Yes, his name's BARRET…
No way!
Hmm? BARRET? That sounds familiar…
You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out about. You know, AVALANCHE…?
Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7, in the slums.
…and how do YOU know that!?
Don't be shy. We're all alone now…
Received "Hyper"!
Please, help me!
Help him
Leave him
I…I was just following the Don's orders! Help me!
Thanks!
You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying someone 'leaked information' and we're 'good for nothings'.
They took Don somewhere and that's it… I'm still here.
Oops! They're here again… I'm outta here! SEE ya
