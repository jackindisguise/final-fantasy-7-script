What took you so long, CLOUD?
CAIT SITH
Oh yeah, about the Temple of the Ancients. I think if we take the Tiny Bronco east towards the sea, we should be able to find it.
CAIT SITH
Well then, shall we get goin'? Who's gonna go?
AERIS
I want to go! I'm going for sure!
CAIT SITH
Then see you later.
Yo! I'm goin' too, CLOUD! Gotta keep movin'!!
CAIT SITH
The Temple of the Ancients is to the east. Shall we go?
TIFA
You know…no, forget it. Let's go.
YUFFIE
I'm startin' to get nervous.
CID
I don't care what's goin' on. Let's just go!
VINCENT
The Temple of the Ancients… This might be pretty interesting…
