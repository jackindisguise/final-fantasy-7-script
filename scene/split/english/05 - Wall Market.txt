Wall Market
AERIS
This place is scary in a lot of ways. Especially for a girl. So we've got to find TIFA fast.
Please come in. There's a free 'Pharmacy Coupon' if you enter now.
Please, stop by.
According to that guy with the tank, if you're strong enough, anyone can make it to the top plate.
So, build your strength by having a plate of our food.
It's a weird world we live in, so eat up and work hard.
I just can't make up my mind… Mmm.
Huh? About what?
Hmmm, don't make me say it… It's the shop down on the right.
Nope, I just can't make up my mind. Here, you take this. You won't be able to get in without it.

…
Say, you're a cutie, heh, heh, heh.
Hey boy! You sure got a good-lookin' heifer there!
Take her to the Don's place, and you'll make a mint.
Hey! Pretty lady. Let me tell you about a good job!
Go to the Don's place. You'll make a small fortune!
I never believed that Sector 7 would ever come down.
We're not leavin' this city no matter what happens.
Hey, you two. Why don't you get some rest?
We have a beautiful room, how 'bout it?
Hey, y'all. Please stay here!
Oh… what should I do? Should I just buy it?
That was scary…
Seems like everything has frills on it.
Aren't cats great? This one's a little big, huh?
It came down from the sky.
But the old guy who likes tanks took all of it away. I wanted some, too.
I wish I could live with a real cat.
It's a little early to start eating. Come back in a bit.
What? Are you ladies going to eat, too?
Phew, it's all dusty ever since the sky came down. I'll have to start over.
I don't know what's gonna happen next. But first, you gotta fill your stomach.
CLOUD
What's wrong, AERIS?
AERIS
What is it? Are you going outside like that? I mean, that's okay with me, but…
CLOUD
…Oh, yeah.
Get a hold of yourself, Ms. CLOUD.
[Save Point]
Wall Market
All this trash. Can't we do anything with it?
All this belongs to the owner of the Weapons Shop. He keeps picking things up and saving them here.
Oh, you mean the owner who has a tank in his shop.
But any way you look at it, it's just trash…
Is this pile of trash getting bigger?
Yes, I think so.
A lot of things came falling down when the Sector 7 pillar fell.
Right, right, you're right. The owner of the Weapons Shop scavenged all the stuff when it came falling down.
Oh is that why? He seems pretty suspicious these days.
Oh, you mean he went out to the Plate cross section next to the Don's Mansion, right?
Oh, you know! I wonder what he's doing?
Yeah! It gives me the chills.
Wanna see somethin' awesome? Follow me!
Honey Bee Inn
AERIS
Hey!! CLOUD!!
Johnny
Man… Should I go…or not?
…I get so mental at times like this. I'm hopeless!!
Johnny
Hey!! Aren't you?
What?? You mean you're…too?
Yeah, me too.
Don't bring me down to your level.”
You're TIFA's childhood friend, and you brought a new girlfriend to a place like this!?
What kind of guy are you!!
What…me too. I decided this after a lot of deep thought. My last memories of Midgar…you know.
But… That guy over there kinda scares me.
What the hell!? You *%^&!! This ain't no #$*&^% show!! I'm busy right now!!
I'm feelin' like there's gonna be a fight!!
Mmm? That's too bad.
This used to be where the Honey Bee Inn was!! Now, it's a barrack for the Shinra soldiers.
Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs like you may meet their destiny here!!
Pretty good, huh? Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha !!
All the young bucks gather and deceive this innocent young girl…
Ohhh boy!! It's healthy, it's wholesome!!
Yeow!! Hey, Princess!!
Johnny
Uh…ummm I, I…
Uh…ummm…
I'm…Jo…Johnny… Nice to meet you.
Yeah, I only talk to the pretty ones.
Mmmm, you're the one. You're just great.
Urrrrgh…no way… I can't go on.
Between our differences and my pay, it just isn't cutting it.
Welcome!! Even unpopular dweebs like you may meet their destiny here!!
You looking for a girlfriend too?
You know a girl named TIFA?
This place doesn't interest me.
Hey, you're pretty fast. TIFA's our newest girl.
But, unfortunately, she's having an interview right now.
Here at the Honey Bee Inn, it's customary for all the new girls to be taken to Don Corneo's mansion.
Don Corneo's a famous dilettante. Now he wants to settle down and is in the market for a bride.
Hmm…Seems to like it just fine. Good for you.
Mmm! Please, please!
The Honey Bee Inn is a private club. Only members can go in. Shoo, shoo.
Hey! Is that a "Member's Card" I see shining in your hot little hand? Please, come in.
AERIS
…Hmmmm. Sure, good excuse…
CLOUD
Looks like I need to go inside to complete my disguise.
CLOUD
See ya!
Uh, sir!! It's almost closing time…
So, please remember any personal belongings.
Uuuh! I want flowers too! But, I get so nervous in front of cute girls…
It just seems natural to get cautious…
I bought some pretty flowers from AERIS.
500 gil, a little expensive. Well, at least I got her name.
Johnny
AERIS… Thanks for the flower and 1 gil.
I'll treasure this! I'm going to dry it and keep it for good luck.
I asked AERIS for a date…
And she said not even if I paid her 1,000,000 gil. Her flowers cost 300 gil, too… She's a good business woman.
AERIS
They bought lots of flowers from me.
It's closing time. …yawn…I'm so sleepy…
Sir, is everything all right? Look, AERIS looks so lonely.
Uurrgh! So, this is it for today, huh?
Ummm, young girls…soft skin. Ummm, OK, I'm refreshed now!
Mmmm? Pretty hard. You work out?
That's funny. A hard, spiky hairstyle! Looks kinda familiar…
Hey!! It's you!!
Sorry, but I already heard about you. In addition to dressing like a woman, it seems you like to smash and grind things.
We only let cultured customers in! Got it? Then you'd better leave!
Heee… The Shinra have occupied this shop!
This shop is now under Shinra rule.
Corneo Hall
Hey, you got a cute one with you!
This is Don Corneo's mansion. He's a big shot here in Wall Market.
Listen, the Don doesn't like men. So get the hell outta here.
This is the mansion of Don Corneo, the most powerful man in Wall Market.
Look, the Don's not into men. So don't let me catch you around here again…
AERIS
Hey, this looks like the Don's mansion. I'll go take a look.
I'll tell TIFA about you.
CLOUD
No!! You can't!!
AERIS
Why?
CLOUD
Do you know what kind of …place this is?
AERIS
Then what am I supposed to do? You want to go in with me?
CLOUD
Well being a man, that'll be pretty hard. Besides if I bust in there, it'll cause too much commotion.
CLOUD
But, I just can't let you go in alone…Oh, man…
CLOUD
First…we need to find out if TIFA's alright…
CLOUD
What's so funny, AERIS?
AERIS
CLOUD, why don't you dress up like a girl? It's the only way.
CLOUD
WHAT!?
AERIS
Just wait. I've got a cute friend I want to bring.
CLOUD
AERIS! I can't…
AERIS
You ARE worried about TIFA, aren't you? Then come on, hurry!
A friend, huh? Sounds pretty good to me.
The Don will be happy, too. Who knows, maybe I can even…heh heh.
Bar
HEY…someone's IN here… Don't look!
Got any medicine on you? I'm too hyper…and…ugh.
What…urk…
Give her medicine
Don't give her it
Huh? You'll really give me some? Thanks.
Phew, I feel better now. This is for your kindness.
What is this? Oh well.
It didn't do a thing, but thanks anyways. Here, this is for your kindness.

Whoops!
Yes? If you want to order, do it at the counter.
Man, times are bad.
AERIS
Excuse us, are you the father of the girl at the Clothing Store?
I own the Clothes Shop… but I ain't your father.
AERIS
I didn't say that…
CLOUD
Make me some clothes.
I don't make men's clothes. And I don't feel like makin' anything right now.
AERIS
CLOUD, you wait over there for a second. I'll try and talk to him.
Why don't you go over there and have something to drink.
AERIS
You know, Mister.
He always said that just once, he'd like to dress up like a girl.
So, that's why I wanted a cute dress for him…
What!? A tough lookin' guy like that?
AERIS
So, how 'bout it? Will you make him one?
…might be interesting. I was gettin' a little bored just makin' regular clothes.
AERIS
Then you'll do it for us?
Yeah, all right. What kind of dress you want?
AERIS
Something…
That feels clean
That feels soft
hm, hm, hm, and?
AERIS
And something…
shiny
that shimmers
Hmm, got it. Y'know I got a friend that has the same taste as him. I'll go talk to him.
Hey, hold on. Wait till I get an image in my head. Gulp…ummm, that's good.
…And then?
Hmm, hmmm, oh really?
Scary, isn't it? You just never know when the plate might come crashing down.
Yeah. I'd like to climb up to the plate if I could.

AERIS
Why?
CLOUD
…AERIS.
AERIS
Gosh!
I'm sorry, lady.
Now here's the thing. Do you know that vending machine in the Inn?
I'm itchin' to know what they're selling in it. I just can't ask a girl to go get it.
What? Why don't I buy it myself? Well to tell you the truth, I got in a fight with the guy at the Inn and can't go there anymore. Come on, so how 'bout it?
CLOUD
…
I'll go
Not interested
AERIS
Finished?
Good, thanks. I'll be waitin' here when you're done.

Oh dear. I've gained weight again.

I bet you could climb all the way up to the upper plate if you used that pipe.
Don't you know? The old man at the Weapon shop can tell you more about it.
These days, you've got to have strength. Come on, you should work out.
All right…1, 2, 3. Squats are all in the rhythm.
I'm doing my best, bro'!
How's… this!?
Are you the one who wants to be cute?

Cute?
AERIS
Right.
And about the wig…
Yeah, I heard. But it'll cost ya.

That's right!
So, you've got to compete with us!
You're right. Let's do squats.
All right! We'll beat you out of this gym!
CLOUD
Are you…
AERIS
THE beautiful Bro?
What? You didn't know? Always running around here sayin' Big Bro' this, Big Bro' that…
Never mind that, come over here.
No, I'll explain the rules.
From the ready position, push [SWITCH] to squat, push [CANCEL] to get up, and push [OK] to go back to the ready position.
So it's [SWITCH], [CANCEL], [OK] in that order.
Got it?
Don't have it
Got it
Then I'll explain it again.
Whoever has the most squats after 30 seconds gets the wig.
I'm not going to lose.
Big Bro's wig is MINE!!
Just be quiet…
It's not fair for you to start right away, So, you want some practice?
A little
Don't need to practice
Then, start practicing!
You had  squats.
Now let's begin the real thing. Start!
He had  squats and you had  squats.
Sorry You lose.
Oh, a tie.
Congratulations, you win.
Since the old man from the clothing store asked me, I can't keep it from you, so…
Oh, now where did I put it?

Excuse me! I'd like to get a dress.
Umm, it might take a little time. Will that be all right?
AERIS
What's the problem?
Well, my father, the owner, has been in a slump lately. You see, he makes all the dresses.
AERIS
And, where is your father?
He's probably plastered at the bar.
AERIS
So… You're saying we can't get a dress unless we do something about your father?
Yes, I'm sorry. He's caused so much trouble.
!
You'd help me bring him back?
AERIS
Well, if we don't do something, we don't get a dress, right?
Really!? Please help my crazy old dad. I just don't know what to do anymore…

You know the gym? You'll find a lot of people there like you. Go and talk to them.
CLOUD
…'like you'? AERIS, what did you tell him?
AERIS
Does it matter? Anyhow, we got a pretty dress!
Hmm, not bad. This may be a new business for me.
Yeah, you're right. Should we try it?
Thanks for showing us something new. My father's got his motivation back now, so the dress is on the house.
AERIS
Walk more nicely like…this, Miss CLOUD.
CLOUD
…What do you mean 'nicely'?
AERIS
Oh you're so cute, Miss CLOUD.

So? Were you able to get the wig?
Looks like you got it. So try it on for size.
Welcome. Please take your time.

You're dressed normal today. If something else interesting comes up, let me in on it.

Hey Grandma. What's the name of the company our son works for?
Oh, Grandpa. Did you forget again?

It's Shinra, you know, Shinra, Inc.? It's the biggest company in the city.
If it's the biggest company, it must be something.
Yeah. It IS really something.
He's doing well, and he told me that he's been promoted to department head.

Bubby!! I heard you collapsed.
Mukki
No, no, no.
Don't get so uptight.
Huh…?
Ugh…!
Mukki
Hmm? They say youth is so long yet so short.
Let's give this next one your best shot.
Mukki
Time's up. Bye, bubby.
I'm so sorry… There's a lot of 'adult' things going on…
For your inconvenience, Please take this, okay?

It happens to me all the time.

Hmm, hmm, hmm…
Ohhh, I just can't seem to lose weight.  Hmm, hmm, hmm…
Sir!! You can't come in here.

Oh my!! (…You're still here? Oh well, good timing anyway.)
Hey, what do you think about me?
Not interested
Whatever…

Not interested
Whatever…

Paste, paste, paste…
(Oh God…here's another one of those guys. You know, the delicate type. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)
Fluff, fluff, fluff…
(Hmm! I guess he doesn't realize his position. I feel sorry for him. Just ignore him, just ignore him.)
Pita, pita, pita…
(God, what a pest! All right, get out of here! You dog…)
(That's it, I'll name him 'pooch'.)
Mix, mix, mix……
(What should I do? Is he following me? Really? What if he follows me home?)
(Poochy'll do it, I'm sure of it…)
Shake, shake, shake…
(You think he's after me? Really? This guy makes me sick… And his eyes are weird, too…)
(Yeah, don't hurt these guys' feelings. Let's at least say 'hi' to him.)
Uhh… Hel…Hello.
What a nice day, today.
Introduce yourself
Say Goodbye
CLOUD
By the way, I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm CLOUD, a jack of all trades.
Oh, yeah…? Welcome, CLOUD.

BYE!! (Phew…I'm safe now…)
Take care…CLOUD.
Uh…. Do you put makeup on?
Eyaaah!
Don't watch!!
Eyaaah!
Don't!
…
…Oh my…
CLOUD
If I were to dress up like a woman… Then I've got to really prepare carefully.
I should be able to put makeup on here.
Have them make me up
Don't do it
CLOUD
I have a favor to ask of you. Can you put makeup on me, too?
…Paste, paste, paste…
Oh…my…

Corneo Hall,1f.
Hey, ladies.
I'll go and let the Don know you're here. Wait here. Don't wander around…
The Don's waiting in his room…  Ha ha ha…
AERIS
Now's our chance. Let's find TIFA.
AERIS
I wonder where she is?
Closed…
Office of
Don Corneo
Keep Out!
Torture Room
AERIS
…TIFA?
AERIS
Nice to meet you. I'm AERIS.
CLOUD's told me a lot about you.
TIFA
…And you are?
Hey you're the one with CLOUD in the park…
AERIS
Right, with CLOUD.
TIFA
Oh…
AERIS
Don't worry. We just met. It's nothing.
TIFA
What do you mean, Don't worry'…about what?
TIFA
No, don't misunderstand.
CLOUD and I grew up together. Nothing more.
AERIS
Poor CLOUD, having to stand here and listen to both of us call him nothing.
AERIS
Right, CLOUD?
TIFA
CLOUD?
TIFA
????
TIFA
CLOUD!?
TIFA
Why are you dressed like that!? And what are you doing here!?
Never mind, what happened to you after the fall!? Are you hurt!?
CLOUD
Slow down, let me answer.
CLOUD
I'm dressed like this because there was no other way to get in here.
CLOUD
I'm all right. AERIS helped me out.
TIFA
Oh, AERIS did…
CLOUD
TIFA, explain what you're doing in a place like this?
TIFA
Yeah, um…
AERIS
Ahem!! I'll just plug my ears.
AERIS
Please, go on with your private conversation.
TIFA
…I'm glad you're OK.
CLOUD
Thanks. What happened?
TIFA
When we got back from the Sector 5 reactor, we saw a weird man.
BARRET caught him and squeezed some information out of him.
CLOUD
That's when the Don's name popped up.
TIFA
Right, Don Corneo.
BARRET told me to leave the lech alone…
TIFA
But something's been bothering me.
CLOUD
I see. So you wanted the story straight from Corneo's mouth.
TIFA
Well, I made it here, but now I'm stuck.
TIFA
Corneo is looking for a bride.
Everyday, he gets three girls, chooses one of them, and then… …well…
TIFA
Anyway, I have to be the …girl for tonight.
AERIS
Sorry, but I overheard…
AERIS
If you know the three girls, there's no problem, right?
TIFA
I guess so, but…
AERIS
We have two here, right?
CLOUD
No, AERIS! I can't involve you.
AERIS
Oh? So it's all right for TIFA to be in danger?
CLOUD
No, I don't want TIFA in…
TIFA
Is it all right?
AERIS
I grew up in the slums… I'm used to danger.
AERIS
Do you trust me?
TIFA
Yes. Thanks, Ms. AERIS.
AERIS
Call me AERIS.
He---y!!
It's time, ladies. The Don is waiting!
I told you not to wander around… I tell ya, women nowadays…
Hurry up, will ya!
CLOUD
I guess I don't need to ask but, the other girl is…

TIFA
You're right, you didn't need…
AERIS
…to ask.
AERIS
They're going to get suspicious if we don't hurry.
TIFA
Ha ha. You know, you don't look bad, if ya don't look closely.
I wonder what BARRET would say if he could see you?
AERIS
Embarrassed? Come on, speak up!
AERIS
Hey, what's the secret?
AERIS
No---!!
AERIS
I'm so sorry!!

Corneo Hall,2f.
Don Corneo
Woo-hoo!
Come, come, don't be so shy…
AERIS
Ye…yes…
But Mr. Don. I'd like you to explain something to me first…
Don Corneo
Of course, my dear. I'll take you through it slowly, step by step. So come on!
AERIS
No, that's not what I meant!
NO, STOP! Just, just wait a second!!
Don Corneo
Come! Come!
Aoooooooh!! I can't wait any longer! Here comes Papa!!
AERIS
CLOUD!!
TIFA
I know…
But you know, Don Corneo, I'd like you to explain something before we start…
Don Corneo
Hm? Oh, you mean about THAT?
Don't worry. I'm single. There, feel better now?
TIFA
No…I wasn't asking about that…
Wait a minute! No, not yet!!
TIFA
CLOUD!!
Don Corneo
…What the hell? Who's there?
AERIS
I'm sorry, Don.
TIFA
You still don't get it do you, Don Corneo?
Don Corneo
What?
TIFA
Shut up, we're asking the questions now…
TIFA
What did your assistants find out? Talk! If you don't tell us…
CLOUD
…I'll chop it off.
Don Corneo
No! Not that! I'll talk! I'll tell you everything!
TIFA
So…talk.
Don Corneo
…I made 'em find out where the man with the gun-arm was. But that's what I was ordered to do.
TIFA
By whom?
Don Corneo
No--! If I told you that, I'd be killed!
TIFA
Talk! If you don't tell us…
AERIS
…I'll rip it off.
Don Corneo
Waaaaaaaaaaah--! It was Heidegger of Shinra!
Heidegger, the head of Peace Preservation!
CLOUD
The head of Peace Preservation!?
TIFA
Did you say the Shinra!? What are they up to!? Talk!
If you don't tell us…
TIFA
…I'll smash it.
Don Corneo
…You're serious, aren't you… …ohboy, ohbooy, ohboy.
…I'm not fooling around here either, you know.
Don Corneo
Shinra's trying to crush a small rebel group called AVALANCHE, and want to infiltrate their hideout.
Don Corneo
And they're really going to crush them…literally. By breaking the supports holding up the plate above them.
TIFA
Break the supports!?
Don Corneo
You know what's going to happen? The plate'll go PING
and everything's gonna go BAMMM!! I heard their hideout's in the Sector 7 Slums…
I'm just glad it's not here in Sector 6.
TIFA
They're going to wipe out the Sector 7 Slums!?
TIFA
CLOUD, will you come with me to Sector 7?
CLOUD
Of course, TIFA.
Don Corneo
Just a second!
CLOUD
Shut up!
Don Corneo
No wait, it'll only take a second.
Why do you think scum like me babbled on about the truth?
Because I've given up on life
Because I'm sure I'll win
Because I'm clueless
Don Corneo
Buuzzzzz! Wrong!
Don Corneo
Woo-hoo!  Right!
Don Corneo
Close, but no cigar!
Don Corneo
Ahh, we're finally alone…
All right, pussycat… Come to daddy!!
Don Corneo
You're so cute, I never get tired of looking at you.
Do you…like me, too?
Of course!
Umm…
Don Corneo
You sure do know how to make a guy feel good!
Then, wh…what do you want to DO?
Whatever YOU want, daddy
I don't care…
Don Corneo
Oh man!  I can't stand it! All right, then…
Give me a kiss!! A KISS!!
All right…
Nope, can't do that…
Don Corneo
Why? WHY? WHY?
CLOUD
Because…
CLOUD
Because I'm gonna need that mouth of yours to give me some information!!
Don Corneo
A man!? You tricked me!!
Somebody get in here NOW!!
Don Corneo
A man!? What's goin' on?
Unfortunately, no one'll be comin' to help.
You're the ones from before! Wh…what the hell's going on?
Ju---st a minute!!
TIFA
CLOUD…
Were you really…?
Information? What information?
Th…then why?
Don Corneo
You don't like me?
There…there isn't someone else, is there?
No, only you
Yes, his name's BARRET…
Don Corneo
No way!
Hmm? BARRET? That sounds familiar…
CLOUD
You know, he's one of the ones you were trying to find out about. You know, AVALANCHE…?
Don Corneo
Oh, yeah, yeah. In Sector 7, in the slums.
Don Corneo
…and how do YOU know that!?
Don Corneo
Woo-hoo!
Don't be shy. We're all alone now…
Received "Hyper"!
Please, help me!
Help him
Leave him
Kotch
I…I was just following the Don's orders! Help me!
Kotch
Thanks!
You know what? After you left, some Shinra guys forced themselves in here saying someone 'leaked information' and we're 'good for nothings'.
They took Don somewhere and that's it… I'm still here.
Kotch
Oops! They're here again… I'm outta here! SEE ya
