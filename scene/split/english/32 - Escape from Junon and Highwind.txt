…ding…
Huh?
The glare…
You'll be okay soon. You've been asleep a long time.
I'm…hungry…
About him?
…I'm scared.
Don't worry. I don't know what happened to CLOUD either.
Guess I shouldn't tell you not to worry…
They don't know if he's alright either.
Is he still…alive?
How long…was I asleep?
Let's see now… Must've been about 7 days.
What about Sephiroth?
It ain't over yet. Remember that huge light, in the Northern Cave?
Well now the crater's surrounded by a huge light barrier.
Everyone knows Sephiroth sleeps in there protected by the barrier.
We can't do a damn thing about it. We just gotta wait till he wakes up.
On top of that, some huge monster called Weapon's been on the rampage.
…Weapon?
Remember that huge monster with Sephiroth, at the bottom of the crater?
Well it's up here now. They say it's some legendary monster from the past.
Weapon…is protecting Sephiroth?
Dunno. But he's been goin' around tearin' stuff up.
Right now that Rufus is fightin' it. I hate to admit it, but he's got guts.
We shoulda been the ones to destroy it, but there ain't no time…
Time…
… Hey! How about Meteor?
Do we have to give up?
…Dunno.
Rufus
I thought CLOUD would show up to save you all…
Professor Hojo wanted to check up on CLOUD, too.
What are you going to do to CLOUD?
Rufus
Sephiroth's alter ego…
Rufus
Meteor has been summoned… Essentially, it's all but over now.
Rufus
So, there's no need for you now.
Rufus
No, maybe there is an important task for you…
Heidegger
President! Preparations for the public execution are complete.
Execution!?
Rufus
You are to be executed for causing this situation.
I take back the good things I said bout this damn jackass!
Rufus
Well, enjoy your last moments together.
Heidegger
I'll tie your arms now.
Heidegger
Hey! Walk straight!
Scarlet
Is everyone here? These are the ones who brought this madness to the world!
The hell are these people?
Scarlet
We will be broadcasting your miserable deaths live on national television.
Scarlet, why a public execution in this day and age?
Scarlet
With the chaos resulting from the Meteor reports, we desperately need to rally public support… it's better that we punish somebody, anybody.
You make me sick…
Scarlet
Ha, ha, ha, ha !
They'll never admit it, but everyone loves this stuff!
Scarlet
We'll start with this girl.
If you've gotta do it…take me first!
Scarlet
Camera, this way! Make sure you get this, the audience just eats up tearful goodbyes!
Scarlet
This is my special gas chamber. Take your time and enjoy a slow painful death.
“”
Scarlet
Stuck up ^%$#&!!
What are you doing!?
Scarlet
What'd you do? Hey! Open it!
First you lock me in this weird place, and now you're telling me to come out? Make up your mind!
Scarlet
Don't make me pry it open!
Gas!!
Gas!!
BARRET, help!!
Hold your breath! Hold on as long as you can!
Come on! I can't hold on forever!
Move your feet and arms, then use your
head to get out of the chair.
[MENU]…(Head)
[SWITCH]…(R Arm)[OK]…(L Arm)
[CANCEL]…(Legs)
Try different patterns.
Try and combine two movements at once.
Which button stops the gas?
Open it---
Scarlet
Well now, the show's about to begin. Ha, ha, ha !
Emergency! Emergency!
Weapon's approaching! Attention all military personnel: take your positions!
Oh no! It's Weapon!
Run!
Scarlet
Hey, hey, all of you!
Scarlet
Damn! Why now?
How does it feel now, Scarlet?
Scarlet
Hmm, so you didn't run? I'm impressed. How do I feel? Right now…
Scarlet
Nngaaaaaahhhh!
Huh!? Sleeping gas?
Weirdo!!
I'm here to help!
Why you… Ain't you part of Shinra?
Let's just say I'm against capital punishment. Besides…I hate this broad. Come on, we gotta help TIFA.
I'll keep watch at the entrance.
It won't open!
#$*&!
The Gas Room's probably locked from a different room!
Hmm, we gotta go with a different plan. Let's get out of this room first.
TIFA! I'll help you, I promise!
Let's run to the airport!
The airport?
Trust me, trust me.
Scarlet
…Fools… I've already pushed the switch…
You can't pass.
Where you goin'? The airport's the other way.
No! They locked this too!
Scarlet
Fools. Now, you can't save the girl.
Scarlet
Ha, ha, ha, ha !!
Goddammit!!
OK, OK time for Plan B. Let's run to the airport!
Why the airport? An' leave TIFA there?
Trust me, trust me. We gotta take a chance.
Damn, man!
I know you're in a hurry! But, may have a word…
Shu'up!! I'm in a hurry!
Kiiiiin…
Don't make so much noise. It's me, ME! YUFFIE!
The hell you doin' here!?
I'll explain later! Now we gotta get to the airport!
Heidegger
It's Weapon.
Rufus
There's been so many attacks lately. Can we handle it?
Heidegger
I believe so. Your orders?
Rufus
No need to ask.
Heidegger
We'll give it a shot from our big cannon.
Heidegger
Open cannon doors!! Activate cannon. Target: Weapon!!
The cannon…
Fire----!!!
Ready!
Rufus
Did we get 'em?
Heidegger
Seems so…
Weapon approaching!
Speed, 50 Knots!
It's heading right toward us!
Heidegger
It can't be! We hit it dead on!
Rufus
How about the cannon?
Heidegger
It'll take time to reload.
Rufus
Then use regular fire power in the meantime!
Heidegger
Yes sir! Open all artillery doors! Target: Weapon! Don't let it land!
Speed, 70 Knots!
Weapon, closing in!!
Not good! It's attacking!
Yo! You sure this is the right way? It's a dead end!
Uh oh? Did I make a wrong turn?
You damn cat! What the hell're we gonna do now? They all be comin' soon!
Yo, better watch my back till the end…partner!
Scarlet
Our little game of hide and seek ends here.
Scarlet
The execution may have been unsuccessful, but your death by falling and crashing into the water below might still be pretty exciting.
Scarlet
Stuck up to the end!
Scarlet
How can you!?
What!?
Scarlet
You!!
Pay back!!
Scarlet
That hurts!
Stop it!
Scarlet
That's enough!
Same to you!!
[OK]…Slap
Quit slapping me! You old $*&^%!!! (Push [OK]!)
Scarlet
Take her away.
Scarlet
God! I can't stand it!
Scarlet
Why are you still standing there!? Catch her and take her away!
Scarlet
Now it's time to pay up. Calm down or I'll drop you!
Scarlet
Kya, ha, ha, ha !
Run…
Run to the end of the Cannon!!
Highwind
You okay?
My cheeks hurt a bit.
Forget it, what's all this about?
Well, I'll catch the details later.
In any case, the airship, Highwind, is now yours.
Ha! Ha…urk!
Well…I'm glad you're safe.
I'm going to stay up here a little longer.
…Urk…I get sick on ships either in the air or water.
I wonder where you're taking me?
Highwind
Dammit! Why didn't ya tell me you could fly an airship!?
I thought… TIFA was gone for good.
Sorry, but I had to do something to trick the enemy.
Come on! Everyone is waiting!
Everyone? Everyone's here?
Yo, CID!
When you're ready, we're headin' for the Corel Reactor. C'mon Leader-man, let's hurry.
CID????
…Urk… …I'm not down yet.
Highwind
Sorry!! Go speak to Captain CID!
TIFA, thank you for a job well done!
CID, thank you for a job well done!
My hands are full, so I'll excuse myself here!

Listen
Don't care
Working on the Highwind, we spent every day slaving under Heidegger.
Whenever he got yelled at by the President, he'd immediately take it out on the crew.
We put up with this all the time, even when he beat us.
I mean, I finally made it on the crew of the famous Highwind, and there's no way I was going to quit over him.
Let's see, it must've been a week ago…it was my shift and we were heading towards the North Cave.
Everyone, including the President and Scarlet, got on.
And with them, I saw CID, a legendary pilot!
And he was looking around the inside of the ship looking really, y'know, nostalgic…
He even talked to us.
I couldn't believe it! I was so impressed! He was every bit as warm-hearted as we'd always heard.
CID said that if he had the Highwind, things would be a lot easier.
And now here we are off to save the Planet. It's true. He really overwhelmed me.
And that's why we decided to help.
After the North Cave, we went to Junon, and I started screaming 'Fire! Fire!'
In the middle of all the commotion, we stole this ship from the Shinra.
That's how it happened. Just a minor mutiny against our leaders.
But BARRET and you were captured by Heidegger…
We waited seven days for a chance to rescue you guys before we finally could.
So thanks to our successful mission, we were able to see you again.
I hope I didn't bore you too much with that long story.
Huh?  Don't you want to test my memory on how we met CID?
I'm not just shooting the breeze! I'm also working!
Oh, yeah, yeah. Are you using Chocobos?
I mean, just loading them up and transporting them.
I wonder what everyone's going to do when this fight's over?
I wonder what's gonna happen to the Highwind?
Where's the next stop? Can't you get there any quicker?
CLOUD, put me in your party, so I can get off this ship.
Hmph!
I wonder why anyone would ever make an airship like this…
Ugh…ugh…
What? Are we there?
I know it's all for Wutai, But I can't take much more of this.
CLOUD…urp…ugh.
You know, I was thinking…phew… Why does Materia always have something to do with battles or magic?
I bet the Ancients must've always been fighting.
It must've been…ugh…terrible…
Are you waiting for CLOUD?
He's flying right now, so you can't get him.
Were you going to force me into the submarine right now?
Quit it! If you want to go, then just leave me behind.
…ooooooh. What're you talking about? I…
What's the pilot like?
Tell him YUFFIE says if he pilots the plane smoothly, I'll give him my autograph…
Headed for…Midgar?
Uh, a, anywhere's fine…I don't care. Just hurry up and land this thing.
CLOUD…sign this.
What is it?
It's a contract that says when the war is over, all the Materia will belong to me.
It's all in there. Read it carefully and then sign it, all right?
Forget it, I'm not even gonna read it.
Whenever I read, I get airsick.
Oh yeah?
I'm the same way, so I can't say too much.
Damn! My plan failed. Let's pick on RED XIII later to let off steam.
Huh?
How would you even know? You don't know how tough it is…getting sick on boats and rides…
So, please…just leave me alone.
I really do understand, YUFFIE. When I get sick on a flight, it's a real killer.
When I was in SOLDIER, I completely forgot about my motion sickness.
Oh…
Isn't there any way to prevent this?
Well, according to my research…
First off, if you're nervous a lot, you won't get sick.
But you can't always be nervous.
With this much space, your best bet is to move around while you're riding.
It also might be a good idea to stretch sometimes, too.
But in SOLDIER, we spent a lot of time in trucks.
That sucked!
And there's one thing you mustn't do when riding.
And that is…
Read!
Read!
Once you get sick, there's nothing anyone can do.
I know it's tough…
…So you’re a little better off than me.
But I don't feel…well.
Highwind
That's a good Chocobo.
I'm bored… I want to ride a Chocobo.
How do I?
Later
Whew…
Listen…you gotta ride in on a Chocobo you've raised yourself.
Then, if you bring your Chocobo to this stable, you can let it rest here.
I'll take care of it for you.
What? How do you raise a Chocobo? Can't say I know much about that.
If you want to know about raising Chocobo, there's a Chocobo ranch near Midgar. You should ask them.
Anyhow, to the world map...
I'm going.
I'm not goin'.
Highwind
Welcome to my airship-the Highwind!
What's wrong!? You should be more excited than that!
CID…
Yeah…
Not enough crew.
Do you think we aren't strong enough without CLOUD?
Do you think we can't save the Planet alone?
Meteor is coming, and Weapon is on the rampage…
At a time like this, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
No idea at all…
Get a hold of yourself, TIFA! C'mon, let's think about this!
No way we can get offa this train we're on!
If only CLOUD was here, everything would be fine.
CLOUD would…
…stand that cocky little way he did, and tell us what to do.
He'd say, 'Everything's under control, TIFA.'
TIFA! When'd you become such a wimp!
I'm sorry, BARRET.
I'm so depressed, I'm surprised at myself.
And TIFA…the reason why we all thought it was CLOUD was because…
I know.
That's why I want to make sure. That's why I have to see him again.
I want you to know I didn't dislike him.
I gotta admit he was a strange dude.
Just when you thought he was cool, he'd do some damn fool thing.
Then when you thought he was smart, he'd show how stupid he was.
Everything about him from his movements to his speech were kinda odd.
Knowin' what I do now, I can see why he was that way.
Well, as long as you stay alive, you just might see him again someday. So cheer up, sis.
…I'll be able to see him someday.
If we can find out where he is, the Highwind'll get us there in no time.
Maybe…
CLOUD is still stuck deep in the North Crater, where the ground cracked and swallowed him up…
Buried in the depths of the underground…
Deep within the earth…are you talking about the Lifestream?
The Lifestream sometimes gushes out from cracks in the ocean floor to the surface.
I heard about such a place.
Maybe, just maybe CLOUD's…
Pilot in training (LV3)
Yaaaaahh! Don't talk to me right now!
Get a hold of yourself!
Pilot in training (LV3)
Waaaaah! Captain CID!
TIFA, sorry, but I've gotta show this moron how to land the ship.
Don't worry, it'll be done in a minute.
Oh, and TIFA…
No matter what your goal is, you've got to be prepared.
Go to the Operation room and get ready.
I put a lot of things for you in the Operation room, so go get ready.
OK! You just signal when you're ready to fly full speed.
Pilot in training (LV4)
Eagggghh! Are we going?
We're going
We're staying put
Pilot in training (LV4)
Eagggggh! We're off!
Well, it takes all kinds.
What're we gonna do now! What can WE do?
Huh? Ain't there nothin' we can do?
An' don' go tellin' us to wait for CLOUD to get better.
Oh, I've got some news.
Yeah, what!? That you a spy?
Yeah… I've already told you I was.
Both Gya ha ha and Kya ha ha are up to something.
Wanna eavesdrop?
Conference Room
Rufus
Now then… We're faced with two issues.
1 Destroy Meteor. 2 Remove the barrier around North Cave and defeat Sephiroth.
Any ideas?
Rufus
What?
Rufus
You're going to ram Meteor?
Do you think we have the technology to do it?
Heidegger
Gya haah hah hah! The first problem's already solved!
Meteor will soon be smashed to bits!
The plan is already in motion. We are collecting Huge Materia from each region.
Gyaa haa ha ha!
Heidegger
We've already collected Materia from Nibelheim. All that's left are Corel and Fort Condor.
I've already dispatched troops to Corel.
Scarlet
Huge Materia is a high-density, special type of Materia made through a special compression process in Mako reactors.
The energy extracted from it is 330 times the strength of normal Materia.
Kya, ha, ha! How about that!?
We will gather all the Huge Materia together and ram it into Meteor.
That will cause a huge explosion, reducing Meteor literally to bits!!
Scarlet
First things first!
Right now, we've got to collect Huge Materia from each area.
That's why we're here… CLOUD… CLOUD has…
Bugenhagen
I see… CLOUD has…
It's true that there are several places on the planet where the Lifestream is gathered.
But most of those places are below the surface where humans cannot reach them.
There's only one place An island in the Southern Sea… 
What did you say? I haven't left here in years… No good. I can't remember.
Bugenhagen
In the Southern Seas I think there was an island where the Lifestream is.
But even if you find CLOUD there…
The Lifestream is a mass of spiritual energy,
and one person alone couldn't stand against such an incredible spiritual current…
Bugenhagen
Listening to you and Nanaki speak has made me feel young again.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Might sound a little sarcastic.
