This is…the Temple of the Ancients…
I…I know… I feel it… The knowledge of the Ancients…floating…
AERIS
You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it with the strength of will.
For the future? For us?

What are you saying? Do you understand?
AERIS
You're uneasy… But happy?
Because I'm here? I'm sorry…I don't understand.

Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
BARRET
It says number 9. He has a tattoo on his neck.

He's number 9. There's a tattoo.
CAIT SITH
Oh!? It's a number 9 tattoo.

Hey! It's Tseng!

Tseng? Of the Turks!?
Tseng
Oh, I've been tricked.
Tseng
It's not the Promised Land… Sephiroth's searching for…
CLOUD
Sephiroth? He's inside!?
Tseng
Look… for yourself…
Tseng
Damn…
Letting AERIS go was the start… of my…bad luck…
The President… was wrong…
AERIS
You're wrong.
The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.
AERIS
And, I'm not going to help.
Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won.
Tseng
…Pretty harsh. Sounds like something… you'd say.
Tseng
The Keystone… Place it…on…the altar…
Received Key Item "Keystone"!
CLOUD
You crying?
AERIS
…Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since we were little…
There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me.
Tseng
I am…still alive…

Geeeez! We got our work cut out for us.
This is starting to get me really dizzy…

Wow, this place is huge! I'm starting to get bored.
VINCENT
No exits… We can't turn back.

It smells the same as Cosmo Canyon.

What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?

AERIS
Whew! We finally caught up to you.
I'm sorry. You waited for me.
AERIS
Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.
They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.
AERIS
Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.
Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.
AERIS
Please, talk to me!
AERIS
No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid?
Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?

Everyone all right? That was rough.
AERIS
Oh no…CLOUD. Come quick!!

Hurry, this way!
AERIS
It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.
No…not knowledge …consciousness…a living soul…
AERIS
It's trying to say something.
AERIS
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
AERIS
What?

What is it?

Wait! Look! It's showing us!
Test Play is up to here.
Elena
Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?
Tseng
…I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.
Elena
Be careful, Tseng.
Tseng
Yeah…
Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?
Elena
Th…Thank you very much.
If I may be excused…
Tseng
Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be…
Tseng
Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth
So you opened the door. Well done.
Tseng
This place…what is it?
Sephiroth
A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients….
Sephiroth
I am becoming one with the Planet.
Tseng
One with the Planet?
Sephiroth
You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.
Sephiroth
All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom…knowledge…
I will meld with it all. I will become one with it… it will become one with me.
Tseng
…You can do that?
Sephiroth
The way…lies here.
Sephiroth
Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.
For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, you will live again as a part of me.
AERIS
Did you see it?
BARRET
Yeah, I saw it.
TIFA
…I saw it.
RED XIII
I…I saw it.
CAIT SITH
…I saw it. Tseng was in bad shape.
YUFFIE
Oh grossness!
VINCENT
An illusion the Ancients showed.
CID
Hey hey! Wh, what's the catch?
CLOUD
…Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?
AERIS
Almost there…
CLOUD
Sephiroth is here, right?
CLOUD
No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here.
I'm taking him out!
BARRET
You mean WE are, right?
TIFA
We're here too, you know.
RED XIII
Don't forget about us!
CAIT SITH
I wonder if he'll go down that easy?
YUFFIE
I have nothing to do with it. But, I guess I'll lend a hand.

Is this Meteor?
CLOUD
Looks like we're locked in.
Sephiroth
Soon… we will become one.
AERIS
How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
Sephiroth
It's simple.
Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury.
Sephiroth
The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury.
Sephiroth
…What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet?
Think how much energy would be gathered!
Sephiroth
Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me.
All that boundless energy will be mine.
Sephiroth
By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence.
Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now…
Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.
AERIS
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?
Injure…the Planet?
Sephiroth
Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic…Meteor.

That'll never happen!

It's nothing.”
AERIS
Sephiroth got away.

…Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.
CLOUD
So this must be Meteor, right?
BARRET
Is it some sort of a disaster?
It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
TIFA
Is something going to fall from the sky?
RED XIII
Something's going to fall down?
CAIT SITH
Oh, so something's going to fall from the sky?  It's going to be something big.
VINCENT
Something huge is falling from the sky?
YUFFIE
I don't know what it is but…
It looks like it's going to make a mess…
CID
I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?
Hmpf! It's not even an omen.
AERIS
…This must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.
AERIS
The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.
It finds small drifting planets with its magic.
AERIS
And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely…
CLOUD
Sephiroth!?
Sephiroth
Ha ha ha… It is not me.
Sephiroth
During the time when the Ancients prospered there existed beings that grew up bathed in abundant Mako.
Sephiroth
They were pure creatures of natural shape. Several remain even now.
Sephiroth
These beings sealed their consciousness within materia, altering their lives for eternity.
Aeris
The summon materia…
Sephiroth
Correct. Such a clever girl.
Sephiroth
The creatures that protect this temple have lived long, relics from the age of the Ancients.
Sephiroth
They belong to this planet even more than you do.
Sephiroth
Heh heh heh… Keep that in mind.
CLOUD
Any sign of Sephiroth?
AERIS
He disappeared.

Black Materia!!
AERIS
Hey!
AERIS
…Black Materia.
AERIS
What should we do, CLOUD?
Shake it
Take it
Leave it
AERIS
Wait a minute. I'll ask!
AERIS
I don't understand…
AERIS
What?
AERIS
Really!?
AERIS
They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.
AERIS
If we could only move this, we could take the Black Materia.
But, the Temple would collapse.
BARRET
Then just leave it.
If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?
TIFA
Let's just leave it, OK?
RED XIII
That'll be safer. If no one else can take it…
Then Sephiroth can't either, right?
CAIT SITH
The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it.
VINCENT
I guess that means it's safe here.
YUFFIE
Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!
CID
Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?
CLOUD
No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.
CLOUD
Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.
It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia.
CLOUD
This place isn't safe.
AERIS
So what are we going to do?
CAIT SITH
I heard your situation!
Hi, CLOUD. This is CAIT SITH.
I overheard the whole story!
CAIT SITH
Don't forget about me.
CAIT SITH
Everything you said makes perfect sense!
You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
CLOUD
We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia. And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
CAIT SITH
So that means you don't trust me?
CAIT SITH
But CLOUD. There's really nothing else you can do.
Everyone, please trust me.
I guess we have no choice
No way
CAIT SITH
All righty then! Leave it all to me!
CAIT SITH
You sure are stubborn, CLOUD.
CAIT SITH
Everyone, hurry up and get outside!
I'll go with you to a safe place.
CAIT SITH
Please hurry, you've got to get out of here!
I'll be waiting at the exit!
CAIT SITH
Please believe me, CLOUD.
Hmmm, I guess I have to
How can I?
CAIT SITH
This must be it!
CAIT SITH
The Ancients sure did a great job making this.
CAIT SITH
I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed…
CAIT SITH
There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's only one me!
CAIT SITH
Don't forget me even if another CAIT SITH comes along.
CAIT SITH
Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet…
CLOUD
What do they mean?
AERIS
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
CLOUD
This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?
Then no one could take it.
AERIS
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.
And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.
As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too. Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
CLOUD
So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?
AERIS
Yes, but there's one thing…
You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.
So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
CLOUD
I see… the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily…
Temple of the Ancients
CLOUD
I guess there's no way we can open it… We'll come back later.
CLOUD
It's warm…

Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's Me!!

Well, everyone… Take care of yourselves!
AERIS
CAIT SITH…
AERIS
Come on, CLOUD… Say something.
CLOUD
I'm not good at this.
CAIT SITH
Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.
AERIS
Why don't you read our fortunes?
CAIT SITH
Say, that's right… I haven't done it in a while, huh?
I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me
Now, what should I predict?
AERIS
Hmm, let's see how compatible CLOUD and I are!
CAIT SITH
That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!
CAIT SITH
Here I go!
CAIT SITH
This isn't good. I can't say it.
Poor TIFA.
AERIS
No! Tell me!
I promise I won't get mad!
CAIT SITH
Is that so? Then I'll tell you.
Looks good. You are perfect for each other!
AERIS's star and CLOUD's star! They show a great future!
CLOUD, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher… I'll do whatever you want me to!
You just call me when it all happens!
CAIT SITH
Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.
This is the final, final farewell!
AERIS
Be strong CAIT SITH!!
CAIT SITH
She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.
CAIT SITH
Owwww…
CAIT SITH
What happened?
CAIT SITH
I can still move more.
CAIT SITH
The Ancients went out of their way to make this great machine.
CAIT SITH
I'm saving this Planet too! I'm a little embarrassed…

CLOUD
As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.
CLOUD
Mmm?
CLOUD
Can you guys use it?
AERIS
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.
CLOUD
You mean lots of spiritual energy?
AERIS
That's right.
One person's power alone won't do it.
Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy…
AERIS

Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.

I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients.
I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients.

It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.
That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.
AERIS
The secret is just up here.

At least it should be. …I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.

Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to AERIS? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
CLOUD
Sephiroth…already knows.
BARRET
Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
TIFA
Let's go, CLOUD.
CLOUD
No.
CLOUD
I might lose it again.
CLOUD
If Sephiroth comes near me I might…
BARRET
Yeah, godammit! It's because of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
CLOUD
My fault?
BARRET
I know you got problems… Hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.
BARRET
But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
TIFA
CLOUD, we came this far… Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
BARRET
Goddamn jackass, that's what you are…
Just think about it… How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?
People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.
But, they go on living. They don't run away… That's just how it is.
TIFA
CLOUD…you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
CLOUD
No…
I'm afraid. If this keeps up, I may go crazy!
I'm afraid…
CLOUD
What…am I supposed to do?
Just pull out of here?
To where?
BARRET
Wait a minute, TIFA. give him a little time.
He has to decide this on his own.
TIFA
CLOUD…
BARRET
You believe in CLOUD… right?
You awake?
Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.
You sure do have good friends.
BARRET
Hey, how are you?
TIFA
CLOUD…
BARRET
I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?
You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?
Either way, if you stay around here all you're gonna do is worry about it.
Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth… If it happens, it happens.
I'll go upside your spikey head and bring you back to normal!
TIFA
CLOUD, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
CLOUD
But…
BARRET
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
CLOUD
…You're…right. He's right, isn't he?
TIFA
Come on, let's go and find AERIS.
CLOUD
…I'm afraid to find out the truth. But…why?
