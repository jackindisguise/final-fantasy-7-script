Costa del Sol Harbor
Damn! Sure is hot here!
But I sure feel better now that I can say good-bye to this sailor suit.
Yo listen up!! Y'all be sure to mingle like regular folks here!
Oh, too bad. I liked BARRET's sailor suit. He looked so cute.
…What'ya mean 'cute'?
Right…well, uh…
BARRET, why don't you use that sailor suit for pajamas?
Right, CLOUD?
Keep your mind on Sephiroth
Remember, this isn't a vacation. We're here after Sephiroth.
I'm going on ahead.
Hmmph, CLOUD. You're the one who's always hangin' around wastin' time.
I'm going to skip this resort!
Ahhh… You look like a bear wearing a marshmallow.
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be the most comfortable, so shu'up!
…puff…puff…
Would you kindly hurry? The heat here is drying my nose.
Yeah, mine, too!!
All right. We'll take a break and then head off.
Don't wander too far off.
I'll wander wherever I damn well want! Who made him the leader?
It looks like my mane got messed up.
I'm going to rest somewhere cool.
I think I'll go swimming.
Sounds good to me!
Hmm? CLOUD, are you thinking of anything in particular?
Your cool exterior's cracking…
Well then, let's go!
Maybe I should get a tan for a change.
Which do you like, CLOUD?
I like fair complexions
Maybe a healthy tan is nice
Got it. I'll remember that.
Don't bother looking for me!
What a long boat ride that was!!
Hmmm… Good work everyone…
Gya, Haa, haa…ha!! Hurry up with that!
Yes, sir!!
I heard Sephiroth was on board.
Yes.
And it seems CLOUD and the others were on board, too.
They all slipped through… You messed up big this time, Heidegger.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Is that all you can do? Give one word answers and apologize for everything?
Do something. I'll be expecting results.
Ready for departure, sir!!
Very well then. That was fast.
You're outstanding. I'll remember you.
YES, SIR!! Thank you, sir.
Remember Heidegger, You're allowed only one mistake.
I'm the boss!
But a bunch of hardworking deckhands like you wouldn't understand.
On the marine blue sea, Gazing at the eternal skies that seem to go on forever… Gives you the feeling like you're taking a nap on the wing of a Cessna.
It's the ultimate high!
He's quite handsome, isn't he?
Oh, don't worry, I'm not talking about you.
I'm talking about President Rufus. Charming, rich, blond… He even looks good in a double-breasted suit.
Heh, heh… I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.
Heh, heh! Got nothing to do with us, does it?
Hey! Spread out, all of you, out!!
Put any fingerprints, scratches, or dents on that plane and I'll put one in your head!
Da plane, da plane!! This's something you'll never be able to do in your lifetime.
So you just watch from a distance… and wish.
Costa del Sol…a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round!
Hmm…Things aren't going well… You can go sightseeing in the city.
You're stowaways, right?
It's okay. I'm used to them.
The truth is, before I worked here, I was one of the best.
Don't bug me. This is Rufus's first official visit since becoming President.
It seems like he's here on business this time.
I'm so jealous of him I could spit. We're both about the same age but he's President.
Oh crap… The manager of Shinra won't come down.
Even though the President's here on business. All he does is play, forgetting everything to do with work.
Rufus complimented me on my job!
Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Damn. I'm soaking wet down to my underwear.
Oops! You must be those AVALANCHE guys!
Quick! Let's get outta here! Heidegger's in charge of the transport ship.
That's tough for both of us.
Ride the Shinra ship?
Yeah, I could go for that
Don't think I could steer it
Oh…is that so?
Yep! Actually, we do have an old junker we're gonna get rid of, And I was thinking about going into the tourist business.
But it's probably tougher than it looks I better think this through a little more…
Yeah. It's too much for an amateur!
Oh, oh, oh!!! I'm gonna quit this company!!
I mean it, I'm really gonna quit!!
Heidegger's such an idiot!!
And Rufus, acting all big!!
God, that sure felt good…
The transport ship won't be sailing for quite awhile. Heidegger's orders.
Thinking of being stowaways?
It's 100 gil to Junon. Give it to me, and I'll put in a good word with the captain.
What'll we do?
Pay up
Thank you. Come back any time you want to stowaway on our ship.
Hey! No money? And you're trying to stowaway? Don't make me laugh!
Okay. Come on. This way.
It's not the most pleasant ride but make the best of it.
Ever since Rufus complimented him, he strutted around for awhile, and haven't heard a peep from him since…
Today's a great day for a nap in the sun. It always puts me in a good mood!
Hey, who're you? You look like you've been around the world twice.
I don't know what your story is,
but hang in there.”
Everyone's in a rush to get one last vacation in before the Meteor strikes. That's why it's so busy here.
[EMPTY LINE]
There's no ship to Junon. Recently, there's been a hoard on materials. Everything's topsy-turvy.
Not gonna be able to nap like this for much longer.
When you put it that way, I feel kind of sad.
The only problem is… will there be anywhere left to land?
But I sure am glad I can get rid of that damn sailor suit.
Oh‚too bad. I liked BARRET's sailor suit. He looked so cute.
Right, CLOUD?
The hell's that supposed to mean!? This happens to be more comfortable, so shu'up!
Remember Heidegger, Only one more mistake.
I'm the boss!
It's the ultimate high!
Don't worry‚I'm not talking about you.
Heh‚heh… I hear the Shinra brass are arriving soon.
Heh‚heh…! Got nothing to do with us‚does it?
Hey! Spread out‚all of you‚out!!
Da plane‚da plane!! Here's something you'll probably never get to do in your lifetime.
Costa del Sol…a harbor paradise where the sun always shines and it's summer all year round!
Hmm…Things aren't going well… You can go sightseeing in the city.
It's okay. I'm used to them.
The truth is‚before I worked here, I was one of the best.
It seems like he's here on business this time.
Oh crap… The Shinra Manager won't come down.
Rufus complimented me on my job!
Wow!! I guess it pays to do good work.
Damn. I'm soaked down to my underwear.
Yeah‚sounds good
I couldn't steer it
I mean it‚I'm really gonna quit!!
God‚that sure felt good…
The transport ship won't be sailing for quite awhile. Heidegger's orders.
House for Sale
CLOUD's Villa
Mmm… five more minutes…
Huh!?
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here. This is so embarrassing.
Take your time and look around.
So are you seriously considering buying?
The heck do ya mean?
I'm out of here
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, please continue.
What are you selling?
That's pretty low. Are you pulling my leg?
I'm talking about this house. This villa used to belong to President Shinra. It only recently came back on the market.
How do you like it?
It has a large lot, comes fully furnished with this goose-down bed, and there's even a basement to boot.
The villagers call it the Shinra Villa.
How much is it?
Not interested
Wha? How do you plan to buy it without a dime on you?
Well, the price, for your information, is a steal at 300,000 gil.
Out of your range? Out! Go on, out!
All items in the basement are included in the sale.
Well, please come by again if you should strike it rich.
I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for that to happen unless you win big at Gold Saucer.
Well, what do you think? Isn't it a fabulous villa?
The feeling you get with owning a villa is simply… indescribable.
Well, let's wait for the captain.
Hmm Is this some kind of joke?
'Praise the Lord,' it's a miracle!! Who'd ever think someone with some real money would ever come here?
I probably shouldn't even ask, but are you really going to buy it?
Yep, 300,000 gil
I changed my mind
Hmm, good-bye!! Good-bye fluffy bed!!
Oh well, I'm kind of glad!
Bought "Villa CLOUD"!
With pleasure
Cellar
Geez my lower back's killing me!
Y, yes…sir!!
How do you do? I'm the manager.
Nice to meet you.
Well, if you'll pardon me, I'll be leaving. Good-night.
Oh, those items are free, so please help yourself.
Received "Fire Ring"!
Received "Power Source"!
Costa del Sol
Say, aren't you bored?
Not that much
Yeah, we fight a lot
Isn't that good? You're just expecting too much.
Oh, really? I'm a little bored.
Come on, back to work now!
Here you are! The Costa del Sol tourist information guide.
What do you want to know?
Where's the inn?
Where're the stores?
Show me around town
Let's see. I recommend a resort located on the outskirts of the city.
If you're looking for souvenirs, we recommend Butch's.
Wait a minute. I'm going to look at my guidebook.
It says, Costa del Sol is the gateway to the West, and is a prominent world renown resort, which has been around for ages.
Come on! I don't care about that!
You wouldn't happen to be…rich?
Oh yeah…
Well, not so
You're kidding! You can't tell just by looking.
But I'll tell you just in case.
After relaxing at Costa del Sol, stop by the Gold Saucer. It's a rich and exciting place to play!
I thought so.
Are you interested? This is the road to Gold Saucer.
Head south to the Gold Saucer, and you'll find casinos and an amusement park.
But if you're planning to walk, you'll have to cross mountains and valleys. I wouldn't recommend it.
But if you're on a vacation, you should go there at least once.
Yo! Wassup! We jus' hangin' out!!
Oh, the sun's so bright! Looks like another wonderful day!
1, 2, 3, here we go!
I heard. That big dog talks like a human.
That's cool …but weird.
It's the ocean. A creepy man was signaling for us to come.
I was scared to come here!
Hm, that's interesting.
It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to.
You see, this tail of mine, moves quite independently of my will.
Grrr…
Shall we play our hand around here?
Not yet. Remember, no compromises.
You're right. After all, this trip was expensive.
But only your average Joes are trying to pick us up.
Well, that's because we're just too beautiful and hard to approach.
I guess so. Well, I envy the plain Janes.
Why don't we compromise? We'll make do with what we have.
How about some 'Soft' as a memento of this wonderful trip? Made especially in Costa del Sol!
Yeah, I'd like to find a gorgeous chick and have a great time.
Well, we're lucky to have that cutie working for us part-time.
Butch
You got me there… We just hired her part-time.
She ran off with our money and Materia.
I guess any situation that seems too good to be true, usually is.
Well, please feel free to browse around. Just don't mind looking at leftovers.
Ah, CLOUD! Let me make a buck why don't you?
I'm sellin' Materia. Why don't you buy some?
Orders are taken at the counter.
It hurts when you kick me with your bare feet!
Why's that!?
Not yet!!
Eaghhh!
It's your fault!
What's wrong with you!?
Whew!!!
Grrrrr…
A man…
A good-looking man…
Grrrr…
…pant…wheeze…
Butch
Good or bad everything's gotta go! It's the end of the world sale!!
Wanna buy a souvenir to remember participating in the Meteor tour?
Oh wow!! Man, that's huge!!
The stars!! They're in flames!!
They're burning. Someday they'll burn out.
The stars are just like our youth.
Bar
Mukki
I really like this town.
You could walk around here naked, and no one'd look twice.
…huff…puff… I can't stand hot places…
…HIC… Mm? Wanna order? We're outta that now.
Hey! I thought you'd drop by.
(That's 1, 2…4 fishes all together…not bad.)
Come on…please. If you don't buy from me… I won't be able to pay the rent.
Yeah, snowboarding's what's happening this year.
I'm sick of surfing.
We're all headin' over to Gold Saucer now.
We're gonna make a ton of money at the Chocobo races.
Then we're gonna take a trip to Icicle Inn and snowboard.
Welcome to Bar del Sol! Here's to tropical nights!
We look like great surfers…
But the only clothes we have are these swim trunks.
I traveled around a long time… And this town has the most beautiful ocean I've ever seen.
Sometimes you can't recognize things when they're right in front of you.
I guess I took it for granted because it's so close, and I was so used to seeing it all the time.
That's why I came back here.
I don't care whether Meteor comes or not, I'm not giving up yet!
I still haven't surfed the best waves of Costa del Sol!
I hope the Meteor doesn't strike before I do.
It's weird seeing Meteor's reflection on the sea in the evening! It gives you the creeps.
But the sun has risen! ???
Well, for that reason, I'm at the store today too.
But don' wan' have stars fall down. You think…same?
Mukki
I just want to sit here with my drink.
My boss is a total arrogant ass!
I'm gonna tell him off! I'm gonna scream my head off!
Isn't that what life's all about? What do you think?
…huff…wheeze… Heat and cold are just memories of the Planet…
Come on…please. If you don't buy from me… I can't pay the rent. No one else will either.
While you're here, forget all those awful things going on outside, and just enjoy yourself.
Costa del Sol Inn
Weren't you with that big sailor?
What's the matter?
I don't know.
Wrong guy? This is bad for us. That guy's taken over the john.
And he hasn't even paid his hotel bill yet.
Listen to this…
A big sailor just busted in here all of a sudden, and took over the restroom.
He's been in there moaning ever since.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
Ah…if you're checking in, would you please pay his bill, too?
Come now, we know he's a friend of yours…(fibber)
Stay
What now? Call it a night?
Stay
I've changed my mind
Cradled by the sound of the ocean… sweet dreams…
Are you sure? Please come again.
Shucks!!  Too bad!
Hey! Hey you! Does your friend have a cute lady?
200 gil a night.
Stay
Changed my mind
You look like you can handle it. Well then…
That's right. Don't worry. Please come by again.
Stay
Changed my mind
You sure? I'll just be playing around here so drop by whenever you feel like it.
You must be tired.
The weather for Costa del Sol tomorrow is going to be…sunny, again.
Good morning. Be careful traveling.
Your party has departed.
Oops…
That's bad luck…
I mean, they have already left.
Wait a minute! There's not enough money here.
Good morning!!
Uh uh!
Hmmm!?
Marlene! You OK?
I'll wear this when I go to see you.
Yo, CLOUD! Still too early, ain't it?
Hey, yo!!! Someone's in here, alright!?
Whew… I don't know why I'm so tired.
I feel a little uneasy.
I dunno
Nothing much
I don't understand anything.
Sorry, but I never think about those things.
How could you say such a thing! Sometimes you make me so mad!
Oh, I never should have brought it up!!
…You're right.
Even I don't understand myself.
I wonder what part of me is like an Ancient?
What is an Ancient supposed to be like? It's strange, isn't it?
I don't understand it…
Ahh…I'm going around in circles. I wonder if there's any answer to this? Everything's so complicated.
I'm going to sleep.
I don't want to talk about it!
Be careful!
I don't feel like doing anything. I just want to spend the rest of my life sleeping.
Will you be staying together?
Yes
No, thanks
Stop looking like a hunted animal! Whatever happens…happens.
Johnny's New Home
What's with YOU?
Johnny
Hey, is it really you?
We were in SOLDIER, and childhood friends before that. You were such a playboy.
And a $#&^ murderer!!
Why can't I remember your name?
I'm CLOUD, and don't forget it
Johnny
That's right. Long time no see. Do you remember me?
That's okay. We'll just pretend like we don't know each other.
A lot of things happened to us. Heh, I better stop my complaining! I sure envy you all living out under the stars.
Johnny
You think you're good enough to brag about how big you are?
From now on, I'm turning over a new leaf!
Johnny
Go on and beat it!
I'm happy like this. So keep out of my life.
Oh, right! I remember that, too.
Johnny
Hee, hee, hee!
Johnny
Ha, ha…oh stop it! That's right. Oh really…
Johnny
Yeah. Oh yeah, and then that time…
Yeah, yeah!
We haven't seen each other for ages and sometimes it's fun to talk about old times for a change.
Johnny
Yeah, don't get mad or anything.
I'll try not to be back too late.
So please don't worry about us!
Worry?
Yeah…
I'm not worried.
Just remember we're leaving early tomorrow.
OK, I know.
…mumble…mumble… (TIFA, promise me you're gonna be happy.)
Johnny
But I'm such a pitiful waste…
…sigh…I'm not good enough for her. What should I do?
Johnny
I proposed to her in the middle of all that Meteor stuff!
I can't think of anything else!
Johnny
No, no, NO!! Meteor's getting closer every minute!!
I wanna live my life right now!! I want to build a home and grow old together with her!
I'm gonna do my best, so you hang in there too!
Costa del Sol
Look, look at that!
Hm?
Who, Hojo?
That girl in the bikini?
Is that man over there, Hojo?
Go over and talk to him.
Not a bad view…
What're you looking at?
That man over there. That's Hojo from Shinra. Get outta here Go talk to him!
God!! What do you want?
I want to talk with him
Is that Hojo?
(Hey, who do you think you are?)
Professor Hojo. That scary man says he wants to talk with you.
(What's his problem?)
Yes, that's right. It's the Professor!
I have a bad feeling about this.
Hojo
…But, Too bad.
No, I remember you all now…
Hojo
Long time no see, CLOUD.
Yes, yes. I remember now.
Hojo…
Hojo
What are you doing?
Hojo
Answer me!
Hojo
You mean Sephiroth?
Did you see him?
Hojo
What is it?
Hojo
Nothing. I just remembered a certain hypothesis…
Haven't you ever had the feeling something is calling you?
Or that you had to visit some place?
To beat him and put an end to all this!
Hojo
Were you in SOLDIER? Heh heh heh! Would you like to be my guinea pig?
Hojo
Oh, now what? Are you going to draw your sword?
CLOUD, don't. If he dies, we won't find out anything!
Stop, CLOUD! I know how you feel, but you mustn't.
Yo, yo! It's a bad idea to kill him.
Ha! Ha! Ha!…
Hojo
Say, aren't you the 'Ancient'? 
I'm AERIS. The least you can do is remember my name.
I know I'm an Ancient. My mother told me.
Hojo
You didn't know!? She died.
Hojo
…I see.
…
Hojo
…mumble…mumble…head west…
He's mumbling slowly… That must mean he's hiding something!
Hey! Answer us!!
Grrr, Grrr… …huff…puff…
It's no use. It's no go.
Professor Hojo is so sweet. He's going to experiment on me.
He never takes off his lab coat even in this heat. I guess that's the mark of an intellectual.
I'll interpret Professor Hojo's whispers.
Head west, past Mt. Corel and keep going…
Did you get that? I didn't understand it well, myself.
I'd be happy to be a guinea pig, if it's for Professor Hojo!
Yes, Professor Hojo. Where?
It looks like the Professor discovered or found a solution to something.
You know, I wonder… if they headed west for Mt. Corel?
I'm getting a little sad.
Professor Hojo looks happy like a child when he discovers something. He gets this big smile and then laughs…
I guess we should chase after him. A vacation for two from Mt. Corel to Gold Saucer.
That's right!! It totally skipped my mind!
There was something I was supposed to tell you.
That's right! It's about that!
It was yesterday. A man wearing a black cape came up from the ocean.
I think he had tickets for the Gold Saucer… no, that wasn't it… I wonder if it was all just an illusion?
Hey! President Rufus came here yesterday.
He used to be the President's little boy. We nicknamed him the little Prez!
He didn't look much different than the surfers on the beach.
heh heh… All the good ones are gone.
What about that one? Shall we make do with her?
But she's got a guy with her.
No problem, I can handle him.
Right? You thought so, too?
Geez! What about those two?
Heh heh…I want the one on the left.
Well then, I guess that leaves me with the one on the right.
Hey… heh heh…don't forget to talk to me, too.
Yipes!! Help!!
…breath…breath! Kind of takes your breath away, don't it!?
If you're headed for Mt. Corel, then you'd better buy some "Soft".
At least that's what they always say, don't they?
Be prepared, and you'll never fear.
Hey, I'm no idiot. I NEVER count my chickens before they hatch! Not bad, huh?
Hmm. Man, I'm draggin' today. It's all Shinra's fault.
I really hate Shinra, Inc.! They're all crooked, those Shinra.
Hmm… What a bitter guy Chill out a bit.
Eeeew!! Leave me alone!
Ublk! …glug…glug… You're gonna make me drown!
Always the same story… Women never pay any attention to me…
If this is your idea of flirting…forget it. I do fine as it is.
The sea, the wind and the sun. Don't you just love the outdoors? It always puts me back on track.
Hey, good timing. Would you mind putting lotion on me?
With pleasure
Sorry
Uhhhnn…
Hey, loosen up a bit.
Eaaggh!! Leave me alone!
I'm trying to learn how to swim before the end of the world.
Sitting around waiting for Meteor to come…… Why's it gotta fall on us?
It's getting closer and closer. Someone will do something, don't you think?
The sea breeze, sun and Meteor. Isn't nature strange?
I don't care even if it is the end of the world, I just want to sit here and drink cocktails!
