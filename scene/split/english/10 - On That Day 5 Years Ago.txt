AERIS
CLOUD, you're late!
BARRET
Yo man, you're late!
CLOUD
Sorry to keep you waiting.
AERIS
Guess everyone's here now.
BARRET
So let's hear your story…
You know, the one about Sephiroth and the crisis of the Planet.
Let's hear it all.
CLOUD
…I used to want to be like Sephiroth, so I joined SOLDIER.
After working with Sephiroth on several missions, we became friends.
BARRET
You call that a friend?
CLOUD
Yeah, well…
He was older than me, and hardly ever talked about himself.
CLOUD
So I guess you'd call us war buddies… We trusted each other. Until one day…
TIFA
…
AERIS
…One day?
CLOUD
After the war it was SOLDIER's duty to put down any resistance against the Shinra.
CLOUD
…that was five years ago.
I was 16…
CLOUD
It sure is raining hard.
CLOUD
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm all right.
CLOUD
I wouldn't know…
I've never had motion sickness.
CLOUD
Everything okay?
Sephiroth
Hey.
Sephiroth
Settle down.
CLOUD
They gave me some new Materia.
I can't wait to use it.
Sephiroth
…Just like a kid.
CLOUD
You going to brief us about this mission?
Sephiroth
This isn't a typical mission.
CLOUD
Good!
Sephiroth
Why do you say that?
CLOUD
I joined SOLDIER to be like you.
But by the time I made First Class, the war was already over.
My big hopes of becoming a hero like you ended with the war.
That's why I always sign up whenever there's a big mission. Kind of a way to prove myself.
CLOUD
Say, how do you feel, MISTER Sephiroth?
Sephiroth
…I thought you wanted a briefing?
Sephiroth
Our mission is to investigate an old Mako reactor.
Sephiroth
There have been reports of it malfunctioning, and producing brutal creatures.
First, we will dispose of those creatures. Then, we'll locate the problem and neutralize it.
CLOUD
Brutal creatures? Where?
Sephiroth
The Mako Reactor at Nibelheim.
CLOUD
Nibelheim…
CLOUD
That's where I'm from.
Sephiroth
Hmm…hometown…
Sir…s, something strange just crashed into the truck!
Sephiroth
That would be our Monster…
Sephiroth
Come on, let's go to work.
CLOUD
Sephiroth's strength is incredible. He is far stronger in reality than any stories you may have heard about him.
AERIS
So… Where do you come in?
CLOUD
Me? I was mesmerized by the way Sephiroth fought.
CLOUD
…and then we reached Nibelheim.
Nibelheim
Sephiroth
How does it feel?
Sephiroth
It's your first time back to your hometown in a long time, right?
Sephiroth
So how does it feel?
I wouldn't know because I don't have a hometown…
CLOUD
Ummm…how 'bout your parents?
Sephiroth
My mother is Jenova. She died right after she gave birth to me. My father…
Sephiroth
What does it matter?
Sephiroth
All right, let's go.
BARRET
Yo wait a minute!!
BARRET
Isn't that, uh…?
BARRET
The name of Sephiroth's mother…
BARRET
I remember Jenova. That's that damn headless spook livin' in the Shinra building.
CLOUD
That's right.
TIFA
BARRET, would you please let us hear what CLOUD has to say? You can ask questions later.
BARRET
TIFA, I was only…
TIFA
Ok CLOUD, continue.
AERIS
The childhood friends are reunited!
CLOUD
…I was really surprised with TIFA.
Sephiroth
The Mako smells pretty bad here.
Psst… (You keep wandering around here and you'll get in trouble.)
Being on watch is so boring.
You want to do what we always do?
Just sit tight, it's your job, right?
CLOUD
Shall we practice?
CLOUD
I'll come and talk to you once in a while. Just stick with it.
Practice? Oh, you mean practice my pose.
Do members of SOLDIER always have to worry about what others think?
How did it go?
…Was it like this?
CLOUD
Good job!
I really don't want to be in SOLDIER.
Nibelheim
CLOUD
…The town was quiet.
Everyone must be in their houses, afraid to come out because of the monsters.
No, maybe they're afraid of us…
Sephiroth
We leave for the reactor at dawn. Make sure you get to sleep early.
Sephiroth
All we need is one lookout, so you others, get some rest.
Sephiroth
Oh, and…
Sephiroth
You may visit your family and friends.
Man… I'm so nervous.
How come?
I'm excited.
Look, you never know when a monster's gonna show up, right?
…That's right. Don't blow your chance to become a hero…
Hey, if you don't calm down, you won't get a good evaluation…
Hmm? You from Shinra?
That's right!
Who are you?
Geez… Big-headed young kid.
I'm the town's… …. …!?
Aren't you CLOUD?
Don't you know me?
CLOUD
You're TIFA's…
Right. I'm TIFA's father.
CLOUD
…Long time no see, sir.
TIFA's father
…Stay away from my daughter.
TIFA's father
We don't need the Shinra's help to protect our town!
TIFA's father
If I knew this was going to happen, I would've made mountain climbing off limits…
TIFA's father
I hate myself for asking you this, but…
Don't take your eyes off of TIFA! Hurry up and go back to her side!
TIFA's father
Until we know that there's no danger, we're not moving.
I heard Sephiroth was coming so I brought my camera.
I want a shot of Sephiroth and a monster.
Take my picture.
Get back in the house, it's dangerous.
I don't take pictures of nobodys.
All right… Fat-head…
Hey? This guy's a real…
You… Are you CLOUD?
Really? So that's how it is, huh?
Gosh, CLOUD, you've grown up to be a nice-looking lad.
Then take my picture
It's dangerous, go home
Let's do this, CLOUD. Let me take a picture of you with Sephiroth.
OK, OK… Fat-head… You're just his assistant.
Think they'd let me take a picture?
What's Sephiroth doing?
Sephiroth
Once the guide gets here, we're heading out.
TIFA's father
Listen to me, Sephiroth. In case something happens…
Sephiroth
…Trust me.
TIFA
I'll be all right, Dad!
I have two men from SOLDIER with me.
TIFA
I'm TIFA. Nice to meet you!
CLOUD
TIFA! You're the guide?
TIFA
That's right.
It so happens I'm the number one guide in this town.
CLOUD
It's too dangerous! I can't get you involved in this!
Sephiroth
There's no problem if you protect her.
Sephiroth
…Let's go.
Umm…
Mr. Sephiroth! Please let me take one picture for a memento!
TIFA, can you ask him for me too?
Great, thank you!
I'll give each of you a copy once I get it developed!
Cheeeeese!
CLOUD
This Mansion…
…No, I'll come here later.
Sephiroth
Hey, stay over here!
CLOUD
Up ahead is…Mt. Nibel.
I'll tell you about the time I went into the mountains.
Sephiroth
Hey, calm down! Wait over here.
…Late again.
I was so nervous. I couldn't get any sleep…
Zangan
There's nothing that'll harm the town, right?
Why?
No way!
CLOUD
…Why do you ask?
CLOUD
It's Sephiroth. He would never do that.
Zangan
The Shinra showed up to eliminate any information that could be embarrassing to the company.
You pick these things up when you travel as much as I do.
Zangan
…Oh my. You sure do have faith.
Is that you, CLOUD?
…Yeah
…No
Mom?
Here, I've brought you something!
Don't tell anyone in town!
Received "Homemade Potion!”
Nibelheim Inn
The, uh… The whole inn's booked up by Shinra for the night.
…?
CLOUD?
Is it you, CLOUD?
It must've been two years.
Say, you've really moved up in the world, being under Sephiroth's command.
Wow…
This is really, somethin'.
You used to be such a scrawny kid, and now look at you!
So, what do you need, CLOUD?
Where's Sephiroth?
Give me a room
How is the town?
He's upstairs.
You STILL haven't found one yet?
It's all reserved for you Shinra people, so I don't mind. But, wouldn't you feel more comfortable staying at home?
Now about the town…
A lot of monsters have been appearing in the last 12 months.
Other than that, there's not much change. Nothing much exciting happens in a little town like this.
It was all right when they were building the reactor,
…while they were still building it.
But once it was completed, it's been bad.
Within a few years, all the trees on the mountain withered away.
I don't know if the reactor was good or bad…
I mean it's easy to say that it was a bad idea now. But what can you do about it?
Anyhow, we've got to get rid of the monsters.
Then, we'll be able to relax a little bit.
I'll let you in on a secret…
The Shinra aren't really popular here.
You know what I mean, right?
You're from here, so you know.
It's the same story I always tell. You still want to hear it?
Yeah, tell me again
No, that's all right
Hey, you want to rest?
Yes, please
Forget it
It's already been paid for. Go on, get some rest.
Hmmmm
Is Shinra here to get rid of the monsters?
CLOUD
And who are you?
I'm Zangan. I travel around the world teaching children martial arts.
Zangan
I have 128 students all over the world!
In this town, a girl named TIFA is my student.
CLOUD
Did you say TIFA?
Zangan
TIFA has good sense. She'll be a powerful fighter.
Zangan
I want to see some Shinra techniques.
And if you see anything you can use, you might want to incorporate some of my techniques.
Well, good luck.
Will we be able to use this place, too?”
Zangan
Oh? Did you come crying home?
I think you probably know better than I do, but…
Nibelheim Inn
Sephiroth
…
Sephiroth
…We have an early start tomorrow. You should get some sleep soon.
It's still early.
Yeah, let's get some sleep.
Sephiroth
…I'm not going to wake you up tomorrow.
CLOUD
What are you looking at?
Sephiroth
…This scenery… I feel like I know this place.
Sephiroth
I've hired a guide to the Mako reactor.
I've heard she's young, I hope we can rely on her…
CLOUD
It was the morning after that, right TIFA?
TIFA
Yes, right…
We're short one bed…
CLOUD
This is…my house. It has nothing to do with what happened five years ago.
CLOUD
Hey…
I can't…remember much else. There's…nothing more to talk about.
AERIS
That's all right, CLOUD.
BARRET
Yo wait, I wanna hear.
AERIS
Me too! It's been a long time, right?
BARRET
Tell us more!
You saw your family, right?
Don't want to talk about it
All right…
BARRET
Well, I ain't gonna force ya…
CLOUD
I don't know if you'd call it a 'family'…
My father…died when I was still young.
That's why my mom…… lived alone in this house.
CLOUD
Yeah, I saw my mom.
CLOUD
My mom…she was a vibrant woman. Hadn't changed at all.
But a few days later, she died…
But when I saw her, she looked fine.
CLOUD
Uh?
Yes?
CLOUD!?
Welcome home, CLOUD!
CLOUD
Hi, Mom.
Come, come… Let me take a look at you!
Hmmm…
You look so handsome.
So is this a SOLDIER uniform?
CLOUD
…Mom, I…
Are you eating right?
CLOUD
I'm all right. The Company takes care of me.
Is that so?
I know you can't cook…
I've been worried sick about you.
CLOUD?
You know, CLOUD…
…isn't that right, CLOUD?
I'll always be your mother…
CLOUD
…Let's stop this…
TIFA's House
TIFA
CLOUD?
Did you go in my house?
Yeah…
No…
CLOUD
I thought you might be home.
CLOUD
I remember you weren't there.
TIFA's House
TIFA
CLOUD?
Did you go into my room?
Yeah
No
Received "Orthopedic Underwear!"
TIFA
CLOUD!!!
It's true
Just kidding. Don't get mad.
TIFA
…CLOUD
We're talking about something really important here.
CLOUD
The letter…
TIFA
Did you read it? My letter?
I'd never do that!
Yeah…
TIFA
Of course!
TIFA
You remember what it said?
I don't remember
I remember clearly
TIFA
Then, let's go on with the story about Sephiroth.
CLOUD
Dear TIFA…
(Remember)
(Stop)
CLOUD
I read it…
It was a letter addressed to TIFA from the son of the guy that runs the General Store…
TIFA, how are you? I just arrived in Midgar eight days ago.
Yesterday, all of Nibelheim got together to welcome me. The only person that we couldn't get a hold of was CLOUD.
But everyone said he wasn't really that close to us. So even if we asked, he probably wouldn't have come anyway.
Well, enough about him.
TIFA
CLOUD… Do you remember all of it?
No, that's it
Yeah, I remember
CLOUD
Because there was some stuff about me…
Midgar is really something. But to tell the truth, I feel so behind on everything… so out of it.
Even the rooms of people in the slums are clean.
Right now I'm living in the slums, but I plan to move to a really nice room, like the ones I've seen in magazines, once I make some money.
…But, to do that, I guess I have to find a job first.  That's right. I still haven't found a job yet.
I lied to my parents and told them I found a great job with Shinra, Inc.
I wonder if it's too late to go back. Sometimes I think I should've taken over my parents' store.
I just made it here to Midgar but all I think about is Nibelheim.
Hey, TIFA… Is that stupid old water tower still working?
Is the old man at the Inn doing well? Are my parents still at the shop everyday? Have any monsters attacked?
And most of all, how are you, TIFA? It feels like I haven't seen you for years.
We were all talking about you last night.
Everyone likes you. But because everyone idolizes you, I couldn't very well stab them in the back.
I always acted cool, but actually, I was just afraid of being jilted.
Wow, if I keep writing like this, this'll become a love letter!
So, I think I'll stop here. Take care. I'll write again.
P.S.  Write me back, okay?
Nibelheim House
…Oh, you're with the Shinra? Welcome.
Making the rounds?
Oh, I'm sorry! It's you, CLOUD! I didn't recognize you.
Shinra----?
Chinra---?
SOLDIER?
SALTZA?
Are you going to kill the monsters?
Are you going to…?
….
CLOUD
These kids are also Sephiroth fans…
He's soooo cool!!
Way cool!!
CLOUD, you've grown up to be a strong man.
Have a safe trip.
Do your best.
Do your best.
Nibelheim Item Store
Welcome.
Hey? Aren't you…?
CLOUD
…Have I been here before? …I don't remember.
BARRET
Now you're pissin' me off!! This don't matter, so get on with it!
Oh, oh, you're…
A Mako Reactor was built in Mt. Nibel.
The cold mountain air of Mt. Nibel
was the same…
TIFA
It gets harder from here! Follow me!
I'm all right. You be careful too, Guide.
Let's hurry.
TIFA
Uh…the bridge!!
Sephiroth
Everyone seems to be all right. Will we be able to get back?
TIFA
These caves are intertwined, like an ant farm…
Oh, and Sephiroth… One person seems to be missing…
Sephiroth
It may sound cruel, but we've no time to search for him. We can't go back, so we must go on. We'll travel together from here.
CLOUD
What's this?
TIFA
A mysteriously colored cave…
Sephiroth
It must be the Mako energy. This mountain is especially abundant in it. That's why the Mako Reactor was built here.
CLOUD
…And what's this?
Sephiroth
A Mako fountain. It's a miracle of nature.
TIFA
It's so beautiful…
TIFA
If the Mako Reactor continues to suck up the energy, this fountain will dry up too…
Sephiroth
Materia. When you condense Mako energy, Materia is produced.
It's very rare to see Materia in its natural state.
CLOUD
By the way… Why is it that when you use Materia you can also use magic, too?
Sephiroth
You were in SOLDIER and didn't even know that?
Sephiroth
…the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients is held in the Materia.
Sephiroth
Anyone with this knowledge can freely use the powers of the land and the Planet. That knowledge interacts between ourselves and the Planet calling up magic…or so they say.
CLOUD
Magic…a mysterious power…
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha !
CLOUD
Did I say somethin' funny?
Sephiroth
A man once told me never to use unscientific terms like 'mysterious power'! It shouldn't even be called 'magic'!
I still remember how angry he was.
CLOUD
Who was that?
Sephiroth
Hojo of Shinra, Inc…. An inexperienced man assigned to take over the work of a great scientist.
He was a walking mass of complexes.
TIFA
A Mako fountain… So this is where the knowledge of the Ancients is.
TIFA
We finally made it. We sure took the long way though.
CLOUD
TIFA, you wait here.
TIFA
I'm going inside, too! I wanna see!
Sephiroth
Only authorized people are allowed in. This place is full of Shinra's industrial secrets.
TIFA
But!
Sephiroth
Take care of the lady.
TIFA
Mm, man!
TIFA
Better take real good care of me, then!
TIFA
Yeah, I remember.
TIFA
Hmm…so it was you?
CLOUD
This is…Jenova, right? It won't open…
Sephiroth
This is the reason for the malfunction. This part is broken.
CLOUD, close the valve.
Sephiroth
Did you close the valve?
Sephiroth
Why did it break?
Sephiroth
…Now I see, Hojo.
But doing this will never put you on the same level as Professor Gast.
Sephiroth
This is a system that condenses and freezes the Mako energy… that is, when it's working correctly.
Now…what does Mako energy become when it's further condensed?
CLOUD
Uh, umm…Oh yeah!  It becomes a Materia.
Sephiroth
Right, normally. But Hojo put something else in there. …Take a look.
Sephiroth
Look through the window.
CLOUD
Wh…what is this!?
Sephiroth
Normal members of SOLDIER are humans that have been showered with Mako.
You're different from the others but still human.
But, what are they? They've been exposed to a far higher degree of Mako than you.
CLOUD
…Is this some kind of monster?
Sephiroth
Exactly. And it's Hojo of Shinra that produced these monsters.
Mutated living organisms produced by Mako energy. That's what these monsters really are.
CLOUD
Normal members of SOLDIER? You mean you're different?
CLOUD
H…hey, Sephiroth!
Sephiroth
No…
Sephiroth
…Was I?
Sephiroth
…Was I created this way, too?
CLOUD
…Sephiroth.
Sephiroth
Am I the same as all these monsters?
Sephiroth
You saw it! All of them…were humans…
CLOUD
Human!? No way!
Sephiroth
…Ever since I was small I've felt…
…that I was different from the others. Special, in some way.
Sephiroth
But… not like this…
Am I…human?
I didn't really understand what Sephiroth meant then.
I was even more surprised that Shinra was producing monsters.
BARRET
Yeah, maybe so. Wanna take a breather here?
BARRET
Hmph! Pokin' his damn nose in where it don't belong. CLOUD! Why don't you finish that story?
RED XIII
(Phew……)
BARRET
(Why you talkin' to me!?)
Save game and take a rest
Keep talking
BARRET
…I get it.
RED XIII
That would seem to explain the increase in the number of monsters recently.
I think we should listen carefully to CLOUD. Don't you think so BARRET?
BARRET
Damn, Shinra! The more I hear, the more I hate 'em!
TIFA
…Who would have ever thought the Mako Reactor held such a secret.
AERIS
TIFA… Were you waiting outside then?
TIFA
…Yes.
CLOUD
We returned to Nibelheim. Sephiroth confined himself to the inn. He didn't even try to talk to me.
TIFA
Then all of a sudden he just disappeared, right?
CLOUD
We found him inside the biggest building in Nibelheim.
TIFA
The villagers used to call it the Shinra mansion.
CLOUD
Long ago, people from Shinra used to live in that mansion…
There's no sign of Sephiroth, but I know I saw him go into this room…
Sephiroth seems different.

Sephiroth
…An apparently dead organism was found in a 2000 year old geological stratum.
Sephiroth
Professor Gast named that organism, Jenova…
Sephiroth
X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova confirmed to be an Ancient…
Sephiroth
X Year, X Month, X Day. Jenova Project approved. The use of Mako Reactor 1 approved for use…
Sephiroth
My mother's name is Jenova… Jenova Project… Is this just a coincidence?
Sephiroth
Professor Gast… Why didn't you tell me anything? …Why did you die?
Sephiroth
Let me be alone.
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Sephiroth didn't come out of the Shinra Mansion…
He continued to read as
if he were possessed by something,
and not once, did the light
in the basement go out…
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…
Sephiroth
Who is it!?
Sephiroth
Hmph…traitor.
CLOUD
Traitor?
Sephiroth
You ignorant traitor. I'll tell you.
This Planet originally belonged to the Cetra. Cetra was a itinerant race. They would migrate in, settle the Planet, then move on…
At the end of their harsh, hard journey, it was said they would find the Promised Land and supreme happiness.
Sephiroth
But, those who disliked journeying appeared. They stopped their migrations, built shelters and elected to lead an easier life.
They took that which the Cetra and the Planet had made without giving back one whit in return!
Sephiroth
Those are your ancestors.
CLOUD
Sephiroth…
Sephiroth
Long ago, disaster struck the Planet.
Sephiroth
Your ancestors escaped… They survived because they hid.
Sephiroth
The Planet was saved by sacrificing the Cetra. After that, your ancestors continued to multiply.
Sephiroth
Now all that's left of the Cetra is in these reports.
CLOUD
What does that have to do with you?
Sephiroth
Don't you see?
Sephiroth
An Ancient named Jenova was found in a 2000 year-old geological stratum.
Sephiroth
The Jenova Project.
Sephiroth
The Jenova Project wanted to produce people with the powers of the Ancients… Or, the Cetra.
Sephiroth
…I am what was produced.
CLOUD
Pr…produced!?
Sephiroth
Yes.
Professor Gast, leader of the Jenova Project and genius scientist, produced me.
CLOUD
How…how did he?
CLOUD
Se…Sephiroth?
Sephiroth
Out of my way. I'm going to see my mother.
Sephiroth
Mother, I'm here to see you. Please, open this door.
TIFA
How could you do that to Papa and all the townspeople?
TIFA
…You promised… You promised that you'd come…… when I was in trouble…
Sephiroth
Mother, let's take the Planet back together.
I've thought of a great idea. Let's go to the Promised Land.
CLOUD
Sephiroth…
CLOUD
My family! My hometown! How could you do this to them!?
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha… They've come again, Mother.
Sephiroth
With her superior power, knowledge, and magic, Mother was destined to become the ruler of this Planet.
Sephiroth
But, they…
These worthless ones, took the Planet from you. Didn't they, Mother?
Sephiroth
But, don't be sad anymore.
CLOUD
What about MY sadness!? My family…friends? The sadness of having my hometown taken away from me!?
It's the same as your sadness!
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…my sadness? What do I have to be sad about?
I am the chosen one. I have been chosen to be the leader of this Planet.
Sephiroth
I have orders to take the Planet back from you stupid people for the Cetra. What should I be sad about?
CLOUD
Sephiroth… I trusted you…
CLOUD
No, you're not the Sephiroth I used to know!
But they.... Those worthless creatures Are stealing the planet from Mother But now I'm here with you so don't worry
CLOUD
…and that's the end of my story.
BARRET
Wait a damn minute! That's it? No more?
CLOUD
…I don't remember.
AERIS
What happened to Sephiroth?
CLOUD
In terms of skill, I couldn't have killed him.
TIFA
Official records state Sephiroth is dead. I read it in the newspaper.
AERIS
Shinra, Inc. owns the newspapers, so you can't rely on that.
CLOUD
…I want to know the truth. I want to know what happened.
I challenged Sephiroth and lived. Why didn't he kill me?
TIFA
…I'm alive, too.
AERIS
A lot of this doesn't make sense. What about Jenova? It was in the Shinra building, right?
CLOUD
Shinra shipped it from Nibelheim to Midgar.
AERIS
Did someone carry it out later? It was missing from the Shinra building.
TIFA
Sephiroth?
BARRET
Damn! None of this makes sense!
I'm going, going, gone!
And I'm leavin' the thinkin' to you!
BARRET
Yo, CLOUD! Let's get a move on!
Wait a sec
Right
BARRET
CLOUD, what's wrong? You just gonna stand there while Sephiroth heads for the Promised Land?
I ain't lettin' Sephiroth or Shinra get to no Promised Land. If they do, then we're all screwed.
Y'know what I'm sayin'?
Beautiful, just beautiful!
Is that all?
BARRET
Jus' leave it to me!
BARRET
Fine! That's good enough.
BARRET
Yo, c'mon let's go!
CLOUD
Oh brother…
TIFA
CLOUD?
TIFA
How bad was I after Sephiroth stabbed me?
CLOUD
I thought you were a goner. …I was so sad.
AERIS
I…
AERIS
The Ancients…Cetra…Jenova… Sephiroth and myself…
TIFA
Let's go. BARRET's waiting.
RED XIII
What a fascinating story…
CLOUD
BARRET and the others are waiting for me at the inn.
BARRET
