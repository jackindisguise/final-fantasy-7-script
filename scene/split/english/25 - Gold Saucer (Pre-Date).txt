Weapon seller
Huh? Oh another customer. You sure picked an out of the way place but…
But if it's the 'Keystone' you're looking for, you're too late. Don't have it.
Keystone?
What? You didn't come here for that?
The 'Keystone' is the key that unlocks the gate to a very old temple somewhere.  “You're not going to believe your ears,
but I heard it was the Temple of the Ancients!!
The Temple of the Ancients?
Ha, hah, hah, hah…
Don't take it seriously. It's just a legend!
Huh? What?
Where is the Temple?
Let's change the subject
Never mind
I sold it already. Yeah well, to tell the truth, I didn't really want to sell it but…
That guy had a way about him that made you feel like it may not be a good idea NOT to sell it to him…
Who did you sell it to?
The manager of the Gold Saucer. think his name was 'Dio'. Said he was going to put it in his museum, then he took off out of here.
Come on…it's only a legend. But if it were true, that sure would be something, huh?
Now that you mention it, I've heard of something called Ultimate Destruction Magic It's supposed to be hidden somewhere in the Temple of the Ancients.
Ultimate Destruction Magic…?
Come on! I said don't take it seriously!
Hey, don't just come bargin' in here!
You again? All right, what is it?
Huh? What? If it's the Keystone you want I already sold it!
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials…
Hey you wouldn't happen to have any Mythril on you, would you? I'll trade you something good if you could spare some.
All the weapons you see here I made myself. But lately I haven't been able to get materials…
Give him some
Forget it
Hey thanks! All right you can help yourself to either a big or small box.
Yeah? Well, guess that's that.

Received "Great Gospel"!

What? You want to rest?
Yep
Nope
Oh all right. You can use that bed.

I got it from the guy in a little shack south of here, past the 'River'.
Dio
If you want to know more, go there and talk to him.
Can you let me borrow this?
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Sorry, but it's not for rent.
Dio
Hmm.
Since you've been good to me in the past, I CAN let you have it on one condition.
One condition?
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Entertain me!
What do I gotta do?
Not in the mood.
Dio
Hoo boy!
Dio
I see… Then let's pretend that this never happened.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh! So! You want the Keystone, right? How 'bout entertaining me first?
What do I gotta do?
Not in the mood.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh. Nothing all that difficult.
This is the Battle Arena. Show me your fighting skills. Just you, boy. I'm expecting a good fight!

That's the best you could do? Well, a promise is a promise. Go ahead, take it.
Dio
Hmm, you did pretty well, young man!
Good, it's a promise, so go ahead and take it. I'll give this to you too.
Dio
Heh, heh, heh! Well done, young man! And, as I promised, you can take it. Oh, and I'll give you this too.

With this Key Materia, We can get in to the Temple of the Ancients. Let's go, CLOUD!
This'll get us into the Temple of the Ancients, right?
Staff
Excuse me, sir.
Staff
I'm sorry. The Tram is out of order right now.
…So?
Staff
I'm really sorry!
Staff
I'm afraid you won't be able to leave until it's fully repaired.
What's wrong?
Too bad. It happens, though.
I know! Let's stay at the hotel! They know me here. I'll go talk to them.
Staff
I will let you know once the repairs are completed.
Are you thinking of just us going back?
Hey, CLOUD, Are we going back without the others?
Are we leaving the others?
CLOUD! Are we just going to leave the others?
We don't usually get the chance to be together like this, huh?
CLOUD, how 'bout it? Can you tell me what's happened so far?
I don't really know what's goin' on because I wasn't here in the beginning.
Yeah! I'm for that!
Good idea.
I been here since the beginnin', an' I still don't know what the hell's goin' on either.
CLOUD, the hell's goin' on? C'mon, tell us!
I'm tired…
All right, I'll give it a shot…
All we have to do now is sleep! You're still young! What're you complaining about?
Phew…
We are going after Sephiroth.
Sephiroth must be in search of the Promised Land.
The Promised Land?
A land full of Mako energy. …Or at least that's what the Shinra believe.
I don't know if it actually exists.
The Cetras will return to the Promised Land. A land that promises boundless happiness.
Cetra? That some kinda disease?
That's what the Ancients call themselves.
Hey, didn't you listen to the elders at Cosmo Canyon?
…You don't 'know' where the Promised Land of the Ancients is.
You search and travel, until you feel it. Then you just know that you've found it.
AERIS…can you feel it too?
I think so.
So Sephiroth is traveling the world because he's searching for the Promised Land? Is that it?
He's searching for that, and one other thing.
The Black Materia?
I heard from Dio that a man in a black cape was lookin' for the Black Materia.
I've never heard of Black Materia…
How many men with black capes and number tattoos are there?
…You know, of course, my tattoo is number 13.
How did you get that tattoo?
…Hojo put it on me. The rest are just war scars, but the number was done by Hojo.
So there are at least 13!?
You know…
I think Hojo did something to those men in the black capes.
But I don't know what it has to do with Sephiroth though…
That's why I think we should just go after Sephiroth himself.
Yeah, me too! It's all just too damn confusin'.
And…
I'm sorry, forget it!
I think I'm tired. I'm going to bed now.
What was that, all of a sudden!?
What!? That's it? I'm goin' to bed!
Is that all? How 'bout the Black Materia?
You wouldn't understand even if I told you.
Now all we gotta do is take action! We're startin' tomorrow!!
CLOUD…
I'm number 13. Am I going to go mad too?
I don't know what Hojo did to you, but you've been all right so far, right?
But…
Be strong.
But, I…
Stop it, RED XIII! Be strong!
TIFA?
You're not the only one who's worried!
I don't know what's goin' on, but we're in a bad situation…
Hey CID, let's go back to our rooms.
…zzzz…zzzz…
