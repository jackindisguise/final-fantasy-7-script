Temple of the Ancients
This is…the Temple of the Ancients…
I…I know… I feel it… The knowledge of the Ancients…floating…
You could become one with the Planet, but you're stopping it with the strength of will.
For the future? For us?
What are you saying? Do you understand?
You're uneasy… But happy?
Because I'm here? I'm sorry…I don't understand.
I want to go inside!

Number 9. Another man with a tattoo.
It says number 9. He has a tattoo on his neck.
He's number 9. There's a tattoo.
Oh!? It's a number 9 tattoo.
He has a tattoo too! Ummm, I think it's number 9.
Hey, he's got a tattoo. It says number 9.
It's a number 9 tattoo.

Hey! It's Tseng!
Tseng? Of the Turks!?
Tseng
Oh, I've been tricked.
Tseng
It's not the Promised Land… Sephiroth's searching for…
Sephiroth? He's inside!?
Tseng
Look… for yourself…
Tseng
Damn…
Letting AERIS go was the start… of my…bad luck…
The President… was wrong…
You're wrong.
The Promised Land isn't like what you imagined.
And, I'm not going to help.
Either way, there was no way Shinra could have won.
Tseng
…Pretty harsh. Sounds like something… you'd say.
Tseng
The Keystone… Place it…on…the altar…
Received Key Item "Keystone"!
You crying?
…Tseng's with our enemy, the Turks, but I've known him since we were little…
There's not a lot of people I can say that about. In fact, there are probably only a handful of people in the world who really know me.
Tseng
I am…still alive…
Let's put the Keystone in.

Damn! So this is the Temple of the Ancients!
Oh man, you gotta be kiddin'. This is makin' me dizzy!
Hey, Cloud! Don't get lost!
Words…feelings… So many of them here.
Geeeez! We got our work cut out for us.
This is starting to get me really dizzy…
@#$%! @#$%! @#$%! What the hell's with this place!
Wow, this place is huge! I'm starting to get bored.
No exits… We can't turn back.
…sniff…sniff… This place smells good.
It smells the same as Cosmo Canyon.
What a strange place. Do you think we're welcome here?
…CLOUD! I know it's going to be tough, but…
Don't give up! We can do it!
Sealed……? That sound brings back memories.

Welcome!
Please come again!
HP/MP Restored!
Whew! We finally caught up to you.
I'm sorry. You waited for me.
Those are the spirit bodies of the Ancients.
They've been away from their Planet for a long time to protect this Temple.
Over the many years, they've lost the ability to talk.
Actually, they didn't need words from the beginning because there was only one objective for those left in the Temple.
Please, talk to me!
No good. I don't understand the rest. Are you afraid?
Is it because Sephiroth is in the Temple? Or something else?
Received "Mop"!
Received "Silver Rifle"!

…phew… We did it!
Everyone all right? That was rough.
Oh no…CLOUD. Come quick!!
Hurry, this way!
It's full of the knowledge of the Ancients.
No…not knowledge …consciousness…a living soul…
It's trying to say something.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
What?
What is it?
…Danger? An evil…consciousness?
…show? You're going to show me?
Temple of the Ancients
What's going on?
Wait! Look! It's showing us!
Test Play is up to here.
Elena
Tseng, what's this? Can we find the Promised Land with this?
Tseng
…I wonder. Anyway, we have to report to the President.
Elena
Be careful, Tseng.
Tseng
Yeah…
Hey Elena, how 'bout dinner after this job's over?
Elena
Th…Thank you very much.
If I may be excused…
Tseng
Is this the Promised Land? No, it can't be…
Tseng
Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth
So you opened the door. Well done.
Tseng
This place…what is it?
Sephiroth
A lost treasure house of knowledge. The wisdom of the Ancients….
Sephiroth
I am becoming one with the Planet.
Tseng
One with the Planet?
Sephiroth
You stupid fools. You have never even thought about it.
Sephiroth
All the spirit energy of this Planet. All its wisdom…knowledge…
I will meld with it all. I will become one with it… it will become one with me.
Tseng
…You can do that?
Sephiroth
The way…lies here.
Sephiroth
Only death awaits you all. But do not fear.
For it is through death that a new spirit energy is born. Soon, you will live again as a part of me.
Did you see it?
Yeah, I saw it.
…I saw it.
I…I saw it.
…I saw it. Tseng was in bad shape.
Oh grossness!
An illusion the Ancients showed.
Hey hey! Wh, what's the catch?
…Where is the room with the pictures on the walls?
Almost there…
Sephiroth is here, right?
No matter what he thinks, it's going to end here.
I'm taking him out!
You mean WE are, right?
We're here too, you know.
Don't forget about us!
I wonder if he'll go down that easy?
I have nothing to do with it. But, I guess I'll lend a hand.
…
All right! Guess you youngsters gotta be enthusiastic like that!

It probably won't hurt if I jump from here...

This is the room with the murals…
Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
Sephiroth
So cold.
I am always by your side.
Sephiroth
Come.
Sephiroth
Splendid.
Sephiroth
A treasure house of knowledge…
I don't understand what you're saying!
Sephiroth
Look well.
At what!?
Sephiroth
At that which adds to the knowledge of…
Sephiroth

CLOUD!!
Hey!! CLOUD!!
Hey, CLOUD!
CLOUD!
CLOUD! What are you doing?
CLOUD! What's going on with you?
What the hell is going on?
What are you doing?
Ha ha ha… Black Materia
CLOUD!! Get a hold of yourself!
CLOUD…
I… CLOUD…
Is this Meteor?
Looks like we're locked in.
Sephiroth
Soon… we will become one.
How do you intend to become one with the Planet?
Sephiroth
It's simple.
Once the Planet is hurt, it gathers Spirit Energy to heal the injury.
Sephiroth
The amount of energy gathered depends on the size of the injury.
Sephiroth
…What would happen if there was an injury that threatened the very life of the Planet?
Think how much energy would be gathered!
Sephiroth
Ha ha ha. And at the center of that injury, will be me.
All that boundless energy will be mine.
Sephiroth
By merging with all the energy of the Planet, I will become a new life form, a new existence.
Melding with the Planet… I will cease to exist as I am now…
Only to be reborn as a 'God' to rule over every soul.
An injury powerful enough to destroy the Planet?
Injure…the Planet?
Sephiroth
Behold that mural. The Ultimate Destructive Magic…Meteor.
That'll never happen!
Wake up!!
Where are you!? Sephiroth!!
Wait, CLOUD!
Temple of the Ancients
CLOUD!!
Hey!! CLOUD!!
Hey, CLOUD!
CLOUD! What's wrong!
CLOUD! What are you doing?
CLOUD! What's wrong with you!?
What the hell is going on!
What are you doing?
Ha ha ha… Black Materia.
Ha ha ha… Call Meteor.
CLOUD!! Get a hold of yourself!
CLOUD…
I'm… CLOUD…
How should I?
…I remember! I remember my way.
…CLOUD.
Mm? What's wrong? Is something wrong?
…It's nothing so don't worry about it.
It's nothing.”
Sephiroth got away.
…Don't worry about it. I understood what he was saying.
So this must be Meteor, right?
Is it some sort of a disaster?
It looks like something's gonna fall from the sky.
Is something going to fall from the sky?
Something's going to fall down?
Oh, so something's going to fall from the sky?  It's going to be something big.
Something huge is falling from the sky?
I don't know what it is but…
It looks like it's going to make a mess…
I don't know what the hell it is but it's falling from the sky?
Hmpf! It's not even an omen.
…This must be magic. Just what Sephiroth was saying.
The Ultimate Destructive Magic, Meteor.
It finds small drifting planets with its magic.
And then collides with them. This Planet might get wiped out entirely…
Sephiroth!?
Sephiroth
Ha ha ha… It is not me.
Sephiroth
During the time when the Ancients prospered there existed beings that grew up bathed in abundant Mako.
Sephiroth
They were pure creatures of natural shape. Several remain even now.
Sephiroth
These beings sealed their consciousness within materia, altering their lives for eternity.
The summon materia…
Sephiroth
Correct. Such a clever girl.
Sephiroth
The creatures that protect this temple have lived long, relics from the age of the Ancients.
Sephiroth
They belong to this planet even more than you do.
Sephiroth
Heh heh heh… Keep that in mind.
Any sign of Sephiroth?
He disappeared.
Received "Bahamut" Materia!
You cannot take on any more Materia.
Please discard some Materia.
We're locked in.
What is this?
…There's something written on it.
B.l.a.c.k…M.a.t.e.r.i.a.
Black Materia!!
Hey!
…Black Materia.
What should we do, CLOUD?
Shake it
Take it
Leave it
Wait a minute. I'll ask!
I don't understand…
What?
Really!?
They said that the Temple itself is the Black Materia.
If we could only move this, we could take the Black Materia.
But, the Temple would collapse.
Then just leave it.
If we can't take it, then neither can Sephiroth, right?
Let's just leave it, OK?
That'll be safer. If no one else can take it…
Then Sephiroth can't either, right?
The Ancients were a mean bunch. This way, no one'll be able to get it.
I guess that means it's safe here.
Let's just leave it and get the hell out of here!
Guess stuff this dangerous is best left alone?
No. We've got to think of a way to get it out.
Because Sephiroth has lots of different flunkies.
It's nothing to him to throw their lives away to get the Black Materia.
This place isn't safe.
So what are we going to do?
I heard your situation!
Hi, CLOUD. This is CAIT SITH.
I overheard the whole story!
Don't forget about me.
Everything you said makes perfect sense!
You can use my stuffed body for the future of the Planet.
We can't let Sephiroth get his hands on the Black Materia. And we can't let the Shinra get theirs on it either.
So that means you don't trust me?
But CLOUD. There's really nothing else you can do.
Everyone, please trust me.
I guess we have no choice
No way
All righty then! Leave it all to me!
You sure are stubborn, CLOUD.
Everyone, hurry up and get outside!
I'll go with you to a safe place.
Please hurry, you've got to get out of here!
I'll be waiting at the exit!
Please believe me, CLOUD.
Hmmm, I guess I have to
How can I?
This must be it!
The Ancients sure did a great job making this.
I can protect the Planet too! I'm kinda embarrassed…
There's plenty of stuffed toys like my body around, but there's only one me!
Don't forget me even if another CAIT SITH comes along.
Good bye, then! I guess I'm off to save the Planet…
What do they mean?
So, this whole building is the Black Materia?
This huge Temple? This is the Black Materia!?
Then no one could take it.
Hmm, it's pretty hard. You see this is a model of the Temple.
And inside it is a device, which gets smaller each time you solve a puzzle.
As the model becomes smaller, you become smaller too. Until it's small enough to fit in the palm of your hand.
So, if we solve the puzzles, the Black Materia will get smaller and smaller and we can take it out?
Yes, but there's one thing…
You can only answer the puzzles inside the Temple.
So, anyone who solves the puzzle will be crushed by the Temple.
I see… the Ancients didn't want dangerous magic to be taken out of the Temple so easily…
Temple of the Ancients
I guess there's no way we can open it… We'll come back later.
It's warm…
This isn't good…
CLOUD… …behind you.
Sorry to keep you waiting!! It's Me!!
I'll handle the rest!
Well, everyone… Take care of yourselves!
CAIT SITH…
Come on, CLOUD… Say something.
I'm not good at this.
Mmm, I understand. I feel the same too.
Why don't you read our fortunes?
Say, that's right… I haven't done it in a while, huh?
I'm so exited. Right or wrong, I'm still the same 'ol me
Now, what should I predict?
Hmm, let's see how compatible CLOUD and I are!
That'll cost ya. Exactly one date!
Here I go!
This isn't good. I can't say it.
Poor TIFA.
No! Tell me!
I promise I won't get mad!
Is that so? Then I'll tell you.
Looks good. You are perfect for each other!
AERIS's star and CLOUD's star! They show a great future!
CLOUD, I'll be your matchmaker, preacher… I'll do whatever you want me to!
You just call me when it all happens!
Thank you for believing in me, knowing that I was a spy.
This is the final, final farewell!
Be strong CAIT SITH!!
She told me to 'Be strong.' I feel so happy.
Owwww…
What happened?
I can still move more.
The Ancients went out of their way to make this great machine.
I'm saving this Planet too! I'm a little embarrassed…
This must be it!
Temple of the Ancients
That's the Black Materia…
Hey! I'll keep watch here!
I'll wait here.
I'll be sittin' out here.
Heh heh…this looks majorly boring, so I'll stay here.
I'm gonna have a smoke out here!
Ahhh!! It's really something, having a smoke at a place like this.
I'll be looking around here.
Got Key Item "Black Materia!"
As long as we have this, Sephiroth won't be able to use Meteor.
Mmm?
Can you guys use it?
Nope, we can't use it right now. You need great spiritual power to use it.
You mean lots of spiritual energy?
That's right.
One person's power alone won't do it.
Somewhere special. Where there's plenty of the Planet's energy…
Oh yeah!
The Promised Land!!
The Promised Land!!
No, but…
Sephiroth is different. He's not an Ancient.
He shouldn't be able to find the Promised Land.
Sephiroth
…Ah, but I have.
Sephiroth
I'm far superior to the Ancients.
I became a traveler of the Lifestream and gained the knowledge and wisdom of the Ancients.
I also gained the knowledge and wisdom of those after the extinction of the Ancients.
And soon, I will create the future.
I won't let you do it! The future is not just yours!
Sephiroth
Ha, ha, ha…I wonder?
Sephiroth
Wake up!
Sh…shut up!

Don't be afraid--!

Oh…
Then, why don't you REALLY worry about it?
And let me handle Sephiroth.
And CLOUD, you take care of yourself.
So you don't have a breakdown, okay?
What is this place?
This forest leads to the City of the Ancients… and is called the Sleeping Forest.
It's only a matter of time before Sephiroth uses Meteor.
That's why I'm going to protect it. Only a survivor of the Cetra, like me, can do it.
The secret is just up here.
At least it should be. …I feel it. It feels like I'm being led by something.
Then, I'll be going now. I'll come back when it's all over.
AERIS?
Sephiroth
Hmm… So she's going to interfere? She'll be a difficult one, don't you think?
Sephiroth
We must stop that girl soon.
…CLOUD.

You look like you was havin' a nightmare.
How are you feeling?
I seem to be OK
Not good
Don't really know
That's good. Man, I didn't know what was gonna happen.
Oh… Better keep it to yourself.
I guess that's right. Well, don't worry too much about it.
You know, CLOUD. AERIS is gone.
Everyone's out looking for AERIS.
…The City of the Ancients. AERIS is headed there.
By herself!? Why did she go by herself!?
Hey, we're goin' too.
Only the Ancients, only AERIS can save us from Meteor…
Then we must go. What'll we do if something happens to AERIS? If Sephiroth finds her, she's in trouble.
Sephiroth…already knows.
Hey! Why are you still sittin' around?
Let's go, CLOUD.
No.
I might lose it again.
If Sephiroth comes near me I might…
Yeah, godammit! It's because of you that Sephiroth got the Black Materia in the first place. It's your damn fault!
My fault?
I know you got problems… Hell, we all do. But you don't even understand yourself.
But you gotta understand that there ain't no gettin' offa this train we're on, till we get to the end of the line.
CLOUD, we came this far… Aren't you going to settle up with Sephiroth?
Goddamn jackass, that's what you are…
Just think about it… How many people in this world do ya think really understand themselves?
People get depressed in life because they don't know what's up.
But, they go on living. They don't run away… That's just how it is.
CLOUD…you'll come with us, right? I believe in you.
No…
I'm afraid. If this keeps up, I may go crazy!
I'm afraid…
What…am I supposed to do?
Just pull out of here?
To where?
Wait a minute, TIFA. give him a little time.
He has to decide this on his own.
CLOUD…
You believe in CLOUD… right?
You awake?
Those people were so worried that they stayed by your side until you woke up.
You sure do have good friends.
Hey, how are you?
CLOUD…
I just wanna know, which is it gonna be?
You wanna find out about yourself? Or are you afraid to find out?
Either way, if you stay around here all you're gonna do is worry about it.
Even if you do go nuts again when you see Sephiroth… If it happens, it happens.
I'll go upside your spikey head and bring you back to normal!
CLOUD, it'll be all right. We're all with you.
But…
If it happens, it happens. Don't worry 'bout it.
…You're…right. He's right, isn't he?
Come on, let's go and find AERIS.
…I'm afraid to find out the truth. But…why?
