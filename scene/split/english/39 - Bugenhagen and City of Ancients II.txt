Yeah, that's why we came.
What to do? Have you lost your way? When that happens, we each have to take a good long look at ourselves.
There's always something in the deepest reaches of our hearts. Something buried, or something forgotten.
Remember it… Whatever that is, must certainly be what you are all looking for…
That's easy enough to say… But, I can't remember a thing.
It must be there. Look harder!
This ain't no good with just us! CLOUD, we gotta get some others in here.
…no good. CLOUD, let's have the others come.
nghh…no good. We alone cannot do it. We need to have the others here.
Ahh, no good. CLOUD you call the others in here too!
You expect me to do that? Let the others do it!
How about it, CLOUD? Shouldn't we have the others come?
I don't know, CLOUD. I think we should have everyone here.
Do you see it? What is it that you are searching for?
Nope. Not a thing. Naw. Can't come up with a thing.
Me either! I don't get any of this!
I remember AERIS a lot.
No…not that. You haven't remembered. You haven't forgotten. That's not it…
How would you say… AERIS was right there all along. Right by our side.
She was so close, we couldn't see her. What AERIS did… The words she left behind…
That reminds me… I was the same.
…as was I.
Me too…
She said she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth's Meteor.
But AERIS is gone.
Is it impossible for us to carry on… what AERIS tried to accomplish?
We ain't no Ancients, if that's what ya mean.
What? Did that girl go off to that place?
That's it!!
What's it?
Of course, CID!
We don't know about it.
What did AERIS know?
Why did she face Sephiroth without running away?
I see… She returned there once again, correct?
Hmmm. Perhaps I'll have you take me there.
You're going too?
What's so surprising about that?
Even I like to get out from time to time and see the outside world. I wonder what did it? I haven't felt like this in ages.
It must be the planet. The planet is calling you!
Yeah, hoo boy, the planet calling…alright.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Then let's go.
Oh yeah, Bugenhagen. I have one more thing I want to ask you.
We're carrying around Huge Materia. This is pretty delicate stuff and we would like to keep it in a safe place…
Ho Ho Hoooo. Then we'll put it upstairs. Now, shall we be on our way?
I'll teach you how to work the machine. Watch carefully now. You just pull here…
You are using Shinra Materia, as a weapon?
Materia is highly dense spiritual energy. A shred of the Planet's life. It should not be used as a weapon.
We must stop using it… or the Planet will be weakened.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Is this what you call Huge Materia?
This is really rare Materia, indeed.
Materia this rare is certain to have a special consciousness enclosed in it.
Ho Ho Hoooo. Good. Now let's leave.
Do you remember how to use the machine down below? If you ever want to see Materia, come here anytime.
The Huge Materia emitted a quiet glow.
The Huge Materia emitted a gentle glow.
The Huge Materia emitted a fiery glow.
The Huge Materia emitted a cold glow.
The color…is the same as command Materia.
The color…is the same as magic Materia.
The color…is the same as summoned Materia.
Is that… Bahamut…?
Command Materia Blend
Magic Materia Blend
Summoned Materia Blend

Maximum level Magic Materia has been lost.

Huge Materia…
It is glowing strangely…
Get closer…
Leave it alone
Go back down
Hmm, hmm, hmm!
Smells like machinery.
Just be patient, old man.
I love this smell.
Of course, I also love the smell of nature, too…
Hmm? The deck's up there?
Then I'll be on the deck just passing the time.
I can feel the workings of the Planet in the smell of the wind. I also feel the greatness of Man's wisdom and the knowledge in the smell of machinery…
Well, bye for now.
Gramps… Sometimes I don't know what he's talking about.
I know you're all dyin' to talk to a babe like me!
But just leave me alone. This ship makes me…urk…!!
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Are you getting something?
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
It says, when the time comes, we must search for 'Holy'.
Holy?
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Even us!?
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
All that is bad will disappear. That is all.
Bugenhagen
Search for Holy… How do we do it?
Bugenhagen
Get the White Materia… This will bond the Planet to humans.
Then speak to the Planet.
If our wish reaches the Planet, the White Materia will begin to glow a pale green.
…This is the end.
AERIS had the White Materia…
But when AERIS died, it fell from the altar…
That's why…this is the end.
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
!?
It is written about the key here…
Bugenhagen
Can you read it?
Damn, dude, you're really somethin'
You're really something, Bugenhagen!!
Wow, grandpa!
Wow!
Way to go, gramps! You're not just another old coot!
I never expected to find a person who could read and understand this difficult writing nowadays.
Really?
Bugenhagen
This's no time for jokes…
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
There's something written in chalk… …(even sunlight can't reach)…(Key)
Bugenhagen
So this note points to where the key is?
Key…? To what?
Bugenhagen
The riddle…then it must have something to do with AERIS.
There's a note written in chalk… …(key)…(in the Music Box)
What does it mean?
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
I'll continue to figure out the Ancients' writing.
A place (Even sunlight won't reach) is where the (key) is, right?
Bugenhagen
Maybe I'll understand more from the writing and get some new information for you.
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Underwater? There's…no way… We need a submarine…
Wait. Submarine…I think there's one at Junon Port.
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
And watch closely what happens.
Bugenhagen
Bugenhagen
Look! Look at the image projected on the screen of the water!
…It's glowing.
Bugenhagen
…AERIS. AERIS has already prayed for Holy.
…After I gave up the Black Materia to Sephiroth… AERIS's words came into my dreams…
She said, she was the only one who could stop Sephiroth… And to do that, there was a secret here…
That was Holy… That's why, she had the White Materia. AERIS knew about here… and what she had to do.
AERIS has left us great hope. But, it cost her life… her future…
I'm sorry…AERIS. I should have figured this out sooner.
…You left without saying a word… It was all so sudden, I couldn't think…
That's why it took so long for me to find out… But, AERIS…I understand now.
AERIS… I'll do the rest.
You mean, WE…
That's 'WE'!
WE'LL take care of it.
You &^$#%^! It's WE! WE!
It's WE! Isn't it WE?
I? …you mean WE.
Not I, dorkus! WE!
What AERIS left us… We shouldn't waste.
The thing  AERIS left for us… We gotta take care of it.
We can't waste what AERIS left for us.
The flower girl gave us a big chance… It'd be sad if we didn't finish it!
What AERIS left us… We mustn't let go to waste…
The hope she left us… We must make stronger…
We've gotta take a chance on the hope she left us!
Thank you…AERIS.
AERIS's voice has already reached the Planet. Just look at the glow of the White Materia.
But…how about Holy? How come Holy isn't moving?
Why?
Bugenhagen
…Him…
He's the only one that could do it.
…Sephiroth. Where are you?
H…Hey!
What happened?
You remember when the Junon Cannon disappeared? Actually, Rufus moved it.
Rufus wants to destroy Sephiroth with it.
That cannon operates on Huge Materia. But the Huge Materia has already been used in the Rocket Plan.
So since the cannon's useless right now, he decided to move it.
To a place where Materia… no, where Mako is gathered…
And, where is that!?
It's similar.
I didn't notice it the last time I came.
This place…is similar to the inside of the Lifestream.
…All the different noise.
…The noise doesn't go through your ears but directly into your head.
It seems to mean something… but I can't quite get it. I hate not knowing what it is.
That's what this is similar to.
Now that you mention it…
Now that you mention it…
Now that you mention it…
My head feels like it's gettin' crushed!
My head feels like it's gettin' crushed.
My head feels like it's getting crushed.
My head, it's about to be crushed.
My head's about to pop.
My head is about to be crushed.
So AERIS came here, too… She stood in this exact spot…
Hmm… AERIS didn't have to come here.
She was able to find out all the information here.
What AERIS needed was that altar…and only that.
AERIS…
AERIS… What were you planning to do?
What…are we supposed to do?
What's wrong!?
It's a strange signal!
From where?
It's coming from this…person (?)
That was a surprise, the controls went crazy.
This ain't good…
Weapon came out of the sea and is heading straight for Midgar.
The new weapon should stop him, right?
I don't know if it's ready or not…
Hey! What's gonna happen to Marlene!?
Doncha worry none, Marlene's in a safe place. She's with AERIS's mama.
BARRET!!
What was that scratching just now!?
As long as Marlene is safe, who cares what else happens, right?
I been itchin' to say this to you for a while now!
When you blew up the Sec.1 reactor how many do you think died?
…that was for the life of the Planet. Ya gotta expect a few casualties.
A few? Whaddya mean 'a few'? What may be a few to you is everything to those who died…
Protect the Planet. Hah! That sure sounds good!
And no one will go against you. So you think you can do whatever you want, right?
I don't wanna hear that from no one in Shinra…
Can't do anything about that…
Stop it!
CAIT SITH… BARRET, he knows what he did.
What we did in Midgar can't be forgotten no matter what the reason.
Right? We haven't forgotten, right?
I know you.
You can't quit the company because you're worried about the people in Midgar, right?
Weapon?
OK! Let's go! We'll beat Weapon ourselves!
Hey CLOUD…
You think we can win against that monster? We got a chance of winnin', right?
How would I know?
But that's no reason for us to just let him go!
We're goin' to Midgar and fight Weapon! Come on, let's move!
Shinra Building 70f
…Reeve. It's your job to adjust the reactor's output.
Kya, hah, hah! Don't worry about adjusting it, Reeve.
Once you open it up all the way everything will go full speed!
Gya hah, hah, hah! The President's sure done it this time!
The whole idea that Meteor will disappear if we defeat Sephiroth is all wrong!
If you remember, Mr. President
It was my idea to fire Mako powered shells.
Will the shells really reach the northern border?
But Mr. President, let's not call it a Mako cannon.
This new weapon is called…
The Sister Ray!
Grandfather!!
…Nanaki? …you're still…here?
I can't leave you like this, Grandfather!
It's the duty of… Seto's son, to guard this canyon and her people…
…listen, Nanaki. I think you may already know.
If you have any mission in life, it is not to defend this valley.
Look at the withering mountain grass. Listen to the warble of the new born chocobo's.
Look always to the eternal flow of time which is far greater than the span of a human life.
It will teach you more, than staying here in the valley…
What you will see will eventually become a part of the Lifestream.
For my children… And for your children…
So please, Nanaki… Go with CLOUD… And use your eyes…your ears…
Ho Ho…
Grandfather!? Grandfather!!!
…oh yes. This is for you.
… Don't scare me like that, Grandfather!
What? You surprised yourself. Now take this.
Received "Limited Moon"!
Ho Ho…Hoooo. Do not worry about me. I'll be watching the future of the Planet.
Ho Ho…Hoooo. You?
It's been a while…since I've been out. I think I must have…tired myself out a bit.
Ahh…don't tell Nanaki. He'll only worry…
Ho Ho…Hoooo. Now, now. Don't look like that. I'm all right.
It's a big world and you must go out and see it… You may even find your life's mate. You never know.
Oh yes…take this along. I think it will look good on you now.
RED XIII… Is Bugenhagen…?
Grandpa told me that he's going away again!
Away?
It seems like he really liked that airship.
He told me he couldn't stay still and just zipped out of here!
He even gave me a gift, look!
Wait a minute. Aren't you supposed to give gifts AFTER you come back?
Ha ha…Grandpa sure is strange! Haa…ha ha…ha…
Hmm… Maybe we'll run into him again somewhere.
Yeah… maybe…
Thanks, CLOUD…
